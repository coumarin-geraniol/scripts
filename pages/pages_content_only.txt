{{<h2>General notion of the holiday Kurban Hayit</h2>

<p>The religious holiday of Kurban Hayit in Uzbekistan was declared in 1991. Preparations for Kurban Hayit begin the day before the holiday and this day is called \"Arafa\". On the day of Arafa, traditional flour products are prepared in each Uzbek family. They are kush-tili, bogursok, orama, chak-chak and others. In the evening a pre-holiday pilaf, which is exchanged between neighbors, is prepared.</p>

<p>Kurban Hayit in Uzbekistan, on a par with other countries, begins with the morning prayer, called Hayit-Namaz. After this sacrifices are made.</p>

<p>The beginning of the holiday of Kurban Bairam coincides with the last day of pilgrimage to Muslim shrines in Saudi Arabia. On the eve of Kurban Bayram pilgrims climb to the mount Arafat. On the day of the sacrifice the faithful make a symbolic beating of Shaitan and a solemn detour around the Kaaba in Mecca. Kurban Hayit is observed in 70 days after the celebration of Uraza Bayram. The holiday lasts for 3-4 days.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, not all the Muslims can go on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Thereupon the Muslim canons are ordered to perform the main part of the ritual wherever the Muslim is.</p>

<p>Regardless the area and the features of the national cuisine, all the Muslims should taste many dishes of meat, as well as many sweets.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Kurban bayram in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbek holidays and festivals/kurban-bayram-in-uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div>

<h2>History of Kurban Bayram</h2>

<p>Once prophet Ibrahim had a dream in which he was told to sacrifice to Allah his own child Ismail. According to the Koran, the dreams of the prophets are true and cannot be brought into question.</p>

<p>Unable to reject the order of the Supreme Being, Ibrahim decided to fulfill the will of the Most High and went with his only son to the Mina valley (nowadays Mecca is here). At the moment when Ibrahim waved a knife, an angel came down to him and stopped him. According to the legend, the order of Allah was the trials for the Prophet to test the steadfastness of his faith.</p>

<p>In response for the Prophet\'s intention to sacrifice the most valuable, Allah granted him mercy and sent the ram out of Paradise for sacrifice without taking the child\'s life.</p>

<h2>Kurban Bayram celebration in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>Kurban Bayram in Uzbekistan, as in any Muslim country begins from the very morning. After bathing and putting on new clothes, the Muslims go to the mosque for the morning prayer. After the prayer is over, the faithful return to the houses, where they sing glorification to Allah. Then the Muslims go to a special site or to the mosque, where they listen to the mullah’s preaches. After the sermon, people visit the cemetery and pray for the deceased.</p>

<p>After the faithful return home they start the rite of sacrifice.</p>

<p>The Muslims in Uzbekistan try to treat the poor, make gifts to friends and relatives during Kurban Bairam; visit each other, as the presence during the rite of sacrifice is considered to be blessed.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Kurban Hayit in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbek holidays and festivals/kurban-hayit-in-uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<p>In the period of Kurban Hayit in Uzbekistan, it is especially noticeable how many ancient local traditions were intertwined with the introduced religious traditions. Children are happy with the holiday most of all. There are toys and sweets that are manufactured and sold only during Kurban Hayit days. They are wooden and tin ratchets, tin horns and clay whistles, lozenges of various shapes and a variety of nuts-and-honey bar.</p>

<p>Kurban Hayit in Uzbekistan, as in other Muslim countries, lasts three days. There is a custom to visit the oldest of the relatives and neighbors. In houses where there is a \"kelin\" (a young wife) guests are welcomed and the kelin meets them, making \"kelin-salom\" (ritual light girdle half-bread). On these days in the Uzbek \"mahallas\" (communities) you can see groups of children, who walk from house to house, admiring elegantly dressed daughters-in-law and treating themselves with sweets from their hands.</p>

{{<h2>General concept of the holiday</h2>

<p>Humanity is arranged in such a way that the young generation takes over from the elder one its experience, knowledge and skills. Even in primitive times, it was common to share responsibilities in the community of people: the stronger people went to the hunt, and wiser ones brought up and passed on the accumulated experience of the youth.</p>

<p>From early childhood we go to school for knowledge. The teacher becomes our second parent. We listen to the teacher, take over his experience and knowledge.</p>

<p>Teachers and tutors are people without whom we would not have been individuals, would not have received vital skills and knowledge. 1st of October - Teacher\'s Day in Uzbekistan is a possibility to express appreciation to these prominent people on their professional festive occasion.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Teacher\'s day in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbek holidays and festivals/Teacher\'s-day-in-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div>

<h2>History of origin of the Teacher’s Day</h2>

<p>Until the middle of the 20th c., nobody thought of honoring people who are engaged in the enlightenment of children, adolescents and even adults. But in 1944, US officials received a letter from a simple teacher from the state of Arkansas.

{{<h2>Navruz – beginning of new life</h2>

<p>When the parks are filled with the hubbub of the birds and the buds on the trees swell, when springs and irrigation ditches wake up from hibernation, the long-awaited holiday of spring Navruz comes to Uzbekistan. It is always celebrated on the vernal equinox, on the 21st of March.</p>

<p>Navruz (or Nowruz) is a spring festival or New Year. The term \"Navruz\" is composed of two Persian words \"nav\" (new) and \"ruz\" (day), that is the first starting day of the most momentous holiday of the Aryans.</p>

<p>Navruz is tied to the natural environmental conditions of the continent and the actual astronomical events. The holiday marks the joyous awakening of every living thing after winter, when farmers begin sowing season.</p>

<p>The origin of the festival is ancient Iranian and associated with the sun worship and the name of the legendary soothsayer Zarathustra. On this day the ancient Persian kings put on a crown on their heads, demonstrating a picture of solar annual cycle, participated in veneration in the Temple of Fire and handed round generous gifts to nationals. Later, \"the spring\" New Year became popular among the majority of peoples of Central Asia, not only Iranian-speaking, but also Turkish, who was influenced by Zoroastrian culture.</p>

<p>Navruz is a new life, new anticipations, and the people’s smile. The brighter Navruz will be, the more generous nature will reward people in the New Year.</p>

<p>Navruz holiday in Uzbekistan is music of karnays, joyous voices of children in nice clothes on their way to a holiday in the morning, set up tables in homes as a symbol of abundance and hospitality. There are many traditions, precisely handed down from one generation to another, which are coupled with this holiday.</p>

Also plenty of snacks, sweet stuff and fruit should be on the table.</p>

<h2>Sumalak – the main holiday dish of Navruz</h2>

<p>The fun of the fair on Navruz day is a plate with germinated wheat! This dish is necessarily present on every festive table.<br />
<br />
From the seeds of sprouted wheat sumalak - the main festive treat is cooked. Sumalak is cooked in a special way; it\'s a real ritual, in which only women participate. During the process women dance, sing songs.</p>

<p>Sumalak is prepared for twenty-four hours. The women slowly stir sprouted wheat grains in a huge pot. The grains gradually transform into a thick viscous brown mass. During the stirring in the boiler one can hear interesting sounds. Small pebbles or nuts, which are well washed, especially placed on the bottom of the boiler at the beginning of cooking sumalak in order it does not burn during cooking. Well, if this stone or a nut will be in your bowl of sumalak, you should rejoice, because the whole year will be successful and happy for you!</p>

There is a popular belief that this recipe was invented by the first people inhabiting Central Asia during the relentless winter. According to one legend, the cold was intense, and almost out of food stocks and settlers could do nothing but cook sprouted wheat grains, along with all the products that they had. This dish helped them to escape from hunger and add strength. Since sumalak has been prepared every year.</p>

They need to gather in the early morning, and then to tie to a long pole. With these poles boys go to the neighbors and congratulate them, and the neighbors treat them with goodies.</p>

<h1>Deserts in Uzbekistan: general description – climate, kingdom of plants and animals in Uzbekistan deserts</h1>
<p>About 75 % of Uzbekistan land is taken up by the greatest world deserts – the Kyzyl-Kum, the Usturt plateau, the Mirzachol (“Golodnaya” steppe – barren steppe) and a new desert in Uzbekistan – Aralkum. The wind and the broiling sun in the deserts of Uzbekistan are masters.</p>
<p>Everything is original, unique and grandiose; a sharply continental climate was notable for its extremes. Twenty-four-hours fluctuations of the temperature in the deserts of Uzbekistan are so great that some day one may see the four seasons of the year. The most torrid places of Uzbekistan are in the Kyzyl-Kum, where the mercury column jumps up to 52 (by Celsius) degrees in the shade, and the sand becomes heated up to 80 – 85 degrees. In such a natural brazier you may not only warm up dinner but even bake eggs. There are about 300 sunny days a year in Uzbekistan. In Uzbekistan deserts in winter it snows little or does not snow at all, the frosts are weak. In spring first rains fall in the desert (80–90 mm per year). The sands drink life-giving moisture and tender green grass suckers stretch up. In a short space of time the desert becomes a bright carpet embroidered by nature. Everything is covered with old saxaul, scarlet poppies, timid tulips, white-yellow daisies. The bushes of calligonum put on red and crimson sarafans. Saxaul, acacia, ephedra break into blossom, the desert gets the wonderful gamut of colours. Unwittingly you may address a question to yourself:”Where is the desert?” Only with the help of a mighty binocular you may find two-seven kilometer chains of bleak asymmetrical sand-hills, which comprise 10% of the whole territory of sand desert.</p>
<p><img title=\"Deserts in Uzbekistan general description\" src=\"images/deserts-in-uzbekistan-general-description.jpg\" alt=\"Deserts in Uzbekistan general description\" width=\"690\" height=\"248\" /></p>
<p>What is the source of life for desert vegetation? They say: Where there is sand there is water. The sand like a zealous master hides every water drop of rain or snow from hot sunny rays into deep underground store-rooms. There are invisible lakes and seas of fresh and half-freshwater, the depth point of which is hundred and more meters under the deserts on the territory of Uzbekistan. In the lowlands with ground water there appear saline soils (solonchaks) which resemble fresh snow by their whiteness.</p>
<p>In spring sanguineous life is in full swing day and night in the desert. For two or three spring months it is filled with singing of nesting birds, rustle of Central Asian tortoises, desert round-headed lizards. The coming of spring into the desert is only a splash of plants’ blooming before cruel, withering, intense heat which becomes settled then for long months.</p>
<p><img title=\"Deserts in Uzbekistan\" src=\"images/deserts-in-uzbekistan.jpg\" alt=\"Deserts in Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" height=\"273\" /></p>
<p>With the coming of summer the nature in the deserts of Uzbekistan becomes torpid. Central Asian tortoises, yellow and small-toothed gophers fall into hibernation till the next spring because of the lack of succulent grass. Only long-clawed ground gophers are afraid of neither hot summer, nor frosty winter. They are awake the whole year round. If you watch the sandy desert in Uzbekistan more carefully, you may see extremely original life on its vast territory. Animals and plants possess historically worked out heat regulation mechanisms, which secure them supportable temperature and water rate. In order to stand heat the plants have a mighty root system, penetrating into a depth of even 15 meters, with the radius up to 30 meters. The leaves are as a rule small. Many plants have no leaves at all. Such plants are less heated, they keep water for a long time. The animals also accommodate themselves to the desert rigorous life. Most of them, mainly reptiles, manage without any water, getting it from organic food in insignificant quantities.</p>
<p>You can have the unforgettable trip to the deserts of Uzbekistan within tours by Peopletravel Company. You will have a great chance and take pictures of deserts of Uzbekistan which will remind landscapes of Uzbekistan deserts.</p>
<p><img title=\"List of deserts in Uzbekistan\" src=\"images/list-of-deserts-in-uzbekistan.jpg\" alt=\"List of deserts in Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" height=\"267\" /></p>
<h2>List of deserts in Uzbekistan</h2>
<h3>Kyzyl-Kum desert</h3>
<p>The desert is the largest desert in Uzbekistan. The name of the <a class=\"in_text\" title=\"Kyzyl-Kum desert\" href=\"about-uzbekistan/uzbekistan-deserts/kyzyl-kum-desert.html\">Kyzyl-Kum desert</a> is translated as “Red Sands”. The sands have a red colour, because these sands were formed by the way of weathering and blowing of basic sandy sedimentations.</p>
<p>The Kyzyl-Kum desert in the North-West is bounded by the <a class=\"in_text\" title=\"Aral Sea\" href=\"trip-to-aral-sea.html\">Aral Sea</a>, in the North-East – the Syrdarya River, in the East – the Tien-Shan and Pamir-Alay mountain spurs, in the South-West – the Amudarya River. The area of the desert is approximately 300 thousand of square kilometers.</p>
<p><img title=\"Kyzyl-Kum desert\" src=\"images/kyzyl-kum-desert.jpg\" alt=\"Kyzyl-Kum desert\" width=\"690\" height=\"278\" /></p>
<p>The Kyzyl-Kum desert is a prairie with relict mountains and folded rocks of the paleozoic era.  The mass of the desert is take up by sandy hills, the height of which reaches 75 meters.  The plain part of the Kyzyl-Kum consists of clays and sandstones. In the North-West and North there are riverine sedimentations of ancient channels of the Syrdarya and Amudarya rivers, once fell into the Aral Sea.</p>
<p>The largest desert in Uzbekistan – Kyzyl-Kum is rich with scantily explored historical sites. So, one of such sites are the ruins of the castles of ancient <a class=\"in_text\" title=\"Khorezm\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/karakalpakstan/khorezm.html\">Khorezm</a>, the culture of which is comparable with other developed nations of the world ancient, yet poorly researched. The main part of the ruins is situated in the Kyzyl-Kum desert. Hypothetically, there are about 300 fortresses, which are had not been dug yet.  The most significant fortresses are <a class=\"in_text\" title=\"Ayaz-Kala\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/karakalpakstan/sightseeing-in-karakalpakstan/ayaz-kala.html\">Ayaz-Kala</a>, <a class=\"in_text\" title=\"Toprak-Kala\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/khiva/sightseeing-in-khiva/toprak-kala.html\">Toprak-Kala</a> and Kyzyl-Kala.</p>
<h3>Usturt plateau</h3>
<p>The <a class=\"in_text\" title=\"Usturt plateau\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/karakalpakstan/sightseeing-in-karakalpakstan/beauty-of-the-drying-lake.html\">Usturt plateau</a>, one of the deserts of Uzbekistan, is located in the Nort-West of the Turan low place. Today the plateau is rising above the plain at 180 – 300 meters. In the South-West the plateau has the separate ranges, resembling small mountain ridges. This part of the plateau is called Bozjira. It is the highest and beautiful part. There are no rivers and lakes on the Usturt plateau.</p>
<p>The Usturt plateau, the mysterious desert in Uzbekistan, is the amazing place on the Earth. For many centuries the Usturt plateau was the crossing of civilizations. It saved the remains of the Scythians, Mongolians and more ancient nations. The ways of great migrations ran across the deserted paths of the plateau.</p>
<p><img title=\"Usturt plateau\" src=\"images/usturt-plateau.jpg\" alt=\"Usturt plateau\" width=\"690\" height=\"278\" /></p>
<p>The archeological sites are the part of the plateau Usturt. In ancientry the caravan ways crossed the plateau. So, the roads of Khorezm-shakhs connected <a class=\"in_text\" title=\"Ferghana valley\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/khiva/\">Khiva</a> with the downloads of the Emba and Volga. And as a result the border between Europe and Asia is this geological formation. Numerous old cemeteries with majestic mausoleums-mazaars (tombs of the saints) are spread along the whole territory of the plateau. It is known, that there are about 60 Neolithic stands on the Usturt plateau.</p>
<p>The Usturt desert on the territory of Uzbekistan can be characterized as a rocky plaster desert. Such soil unfavorably affects the development of vegetation. A great deal of animals and plants are included in Red Books.  Such animals as saigas (Asian antelope), goitered gazelles, susliks (ground squirrel), jerboas, tolai hares, foxes, corsacs and wolves inhabit this place.</p>
<h3>Mirzachol</h3>
<p><a class=\"in_text\" title=\"Mirzachol\" href=\"about-uzbekistan/uzbekistan-deserts/mirzachol-hunger-steppe.html\">Mirzachol</a> is located at the foothills of the ranges of the Western part of the Turkestan and Nuratau ridges. It stretches to the North and North-East till the <a class=\"in_text\" title=\"Ferghana valley\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/ferghana-valley/\">Ferghana valley</a>, and in the North-West it is joined with the Kyzyl-Kum desert. It’s area takes about 10 thousand square kilometers.</p>
<p>Mirzachol is a clay desert on the territory of Uzbekistan. Plants get melt water and atmospheric precipitation having no resources to get moisture through the clay layer. Mirzachol – barren steppe, or Golodnaya steppe got its name owing to the fact that during a small amount of precipitation, dry air and high temperatures, there is a strong evaporation and drying of the soil, which perniciously influences on the cultivation of cotton and other crops. So, appeared a great need in sewage farms.</p>
 
<p><img title=\"Mirzachol\" src=\"images/mirzachol.jpg\" alt=\"Mirzachol\" /></p>
<p>The development of irrigation of Mirzachol has a long history. The first attempts to flooding have been undertaken in the middle of the last century. Melioration of Mirzachol is a set of activities aimed primarily at salinization of soil.</p>
<p>Mirzachol was watered. This made it possible to transform the barren desert on the territory of Uzbekistan into a large area of cotton.</p>
<h3>Aralkum</h3>
<p><a class=\"in_text\" title=\"Aralkum\" href=\"about-uzbekistan/uzbekistan-deserts/aralkum-desert.html\">Aralkum</a> is a new desert in Uzbekistan which was formed on the place of the Aral Sea. The Aralkum desert has a sandy saline ground. The problem of the drying Aral Sea came into existence at the beginning of 60-s. The analysis of the history of the Aral Sea in the past 40 years allows researchers to conclude that the sea has dried half. Today the area of the Aralkum desert is estimated in 38 thousand square kilometers.</p>
<p><img title=\"Aralkum\" src=\"images/aralkum.jpg\" alt=\"Aralkum\" width=\"690\" height=\"308\" /></p>
<p>The flora of the Aralkum desert counts 34 families of plants with 134 sorts and 300 types.</p>
<p>There is an interesting fact. Over the last thousand years the Aral Sea dried out not less than three times. It happened in the X, XIV and XX centuries. And there is a hope that the Aral Sea will appear in all its originality.</p>

{{<h1>Mirzachol - Hunger Steppe</h1>

<p>\"If you happen to see the caravan away, you will notice that it is in a hurry to hide from you for fear that you don’t ask for water, which is much cherished here. Lord, help not to stay on the road during the crossings or shedding water available in the reserve. You can be sure that will not get any aid. Add to this the heat of 40 ° Reaumur in the month of May in the shade, a strong reflection of the sun, which unbearably worries eyes, fatigue during the day, and finally, \"pleasant\" night on the ground in a society with a phalanxes - and you will form an at least approximately notion about the conditions of stay in the Hunger Steppe\"- one of the first researchers of the Hunger Steppe, N.F.Ulyanov, wrote in the seventies of the nineteenth century.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Mirzachol - Hunger Steppe\"  src=\"images/mirzachol-hunger-steppe.jpg\" title=\"Mirzachol - Hunger Steppe\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>The scientist-geographer, Semyonov-Tien Shan, in his book \"Turkestan\" gives the following description of the Hunger steppe: \"In the summer, the Hunger Steppe is a yellow-gray plain burnt by the sun that when the scorching heat and the complete absence of life justifies its name ... In May grass turns yellow, paints fade, birds fly, turtles hide in burrows, and the steppe again becomes lifeless, parched space on the horizon of which barely visible in the hot air the distant snowy peaks looms.\"</p>

<p>But the desert only seemingly was dead; it harbored rich opportunities for the benefit of people. A green grass in early spring, bright red fields of poppies talked about soil fertility. For that summer did not bring to the steppe lifelessness of the desert, it was necessary to counter the searing heat life-giving water. People did it thanks to irrigation of the Hunger Steppe.&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Hunger steppe in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/hunger-steppe-in-uzbekistan.jpg\" title=\"Hunger steppe in Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Dozens of new engineering solutions received a start in life in the Hungry Steppe. Here, the first in Uzbekistan engineering irrigation system was built.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say when and who first called it the Hunger Steppe. Now this name sounds stark contrast that covers the eyes of people traveling and living here. But a hundred or a hundred and thirty years ago, when the first explorers set foot here, the name was justified by the reality. Apparently, to someone from these pioneers belongs the idea to give such an apt and intimidating name.</p>

<p>The places were called the Hunger Steppe (another variant - Hungry Steppe) or Golodnaya Steppe, and the local people called it \"Mirzachol\".</p>

<h2>Golodnaya Steppe, Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>The Golodnaya Steppe geographically defines the vast plain with the length of over 150 km, inclined from the foothills of the Turkestan range in the floodplain of the Syr Darya river within the middle of its course, from the Farkhad corridor to the hole Chardara. In the west, the Mirzachol&nbsp;Steppe is limited by the Arnasay depression and the lake Tuzkan - a huge water area, waste tank of Syr Darya. This natural body of water lying at the lowest elevations in the Golodnaya Steppe - about 240 m. separates it from the boundless steppe sands of the Kyzyl kum desert. The width of the Mirzachol Steppe along the Turkestan range is 70-120 km.</p>

<h2>Climate in the&nbsp;Golodnaya Steppe</h2>

<p>The climate of the Golodnaya Steppe is sharply continental. The average temperature in July +27,9 ° C, in January - 2,1 ° C.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Golodnaya steppe in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/golodnaya-steppe-in-uzbekistan.jpg\" title=\"Golodnaya steppe in Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>One of the distinguishing features of the climate is that rainfall in the Golodnaya Steppe is in the range of 250 to 350 mm, which is much higher than in the Fergana Valley, Khorezm, Kashkadarya, etc. The distribution of rainfall over time is also favourable: they fall mainly in winter and spring, and contribute to the accumulation of natural moisture during and after planting, in which seedlings of the most crops are obtained on the natural moisture.</p>

<h2>Development of the Golodnaya Steppe&nbsp;in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>The development of the Golodnaya Steppe&nbsp;dates from the end of the XIX century, when the steppe finally became a part of the Russian Empire. Before the First World War in the Mirzachol the construction of irrigation canals was started.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the wide involvement of the Golodnaya Steppe&nbsp;lands into economic circulation is associated with Soviet times of the year 1918, when by the decree of the Council of People\'s Commissars it was envisaged to irrigate 500 thousand acres of land in the Mirzachol desert. In 1956, for the purpose of development of cotton monoculture, extensive spaces of the Golodnaya Steppe&nbsp;were flooded. This made it possible to transform the barren deserts into a large area (an area of about 800,000 hectares) of cotton in the Uzbek SSR.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Mirzachol desert\"  src=\"images/mirzachol-desert.jpg\" title=\"Mirzachol desert\" width=\"690\" /></div> <br />

<p>The irrigation of the Golodnaya Steppe&nbsp;ended with the victory of engineering thought, engineering, and scientific developments of advanced Russian intelligentsia - scientists, engineers, agronomists, specialists; and victory of simple Uzbek farmers who had proven the ability to cope with the desert. New farms, towns and villages grew in the Golodnaya Steppe.</p>

<h2>Legends and stories about the Mirzachol desert</h2>

<p>The past of the Mirzachol Steppe is associated with the legends and tales, in which people expressed their desire to irrigate the desert.</p>

<p>In one legend, for example, it is told that the space from the village Chinaz to the city of Jizzakh all was settled; and there was so much greenery and trees that a nightingale could fly from one village to another, flitting from branch to branch. In this legend dream of the peoples of mastering the empty steppe was clearly reflected.</p>

<p>The poetic legend about Farhad and Shirin, sung by Alisher Navoi is connected with the Mirzachol Steppe.</p>

<p>The geographical location of the Golodnaya Steppe constantly attracted its attention at all stages of modern history. For many centuries ancient caravan routes from the Sogd-State referred in the IV century BC and covering the irrigated area in the valley of Zarafshan and middle reaches of the Amu Darya - in Shash (Tashkent), in Fergana and further along the Great Silk Road to China, passed here. The troops of Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan marched here. Along the Turkestan Range there was a caravan route mail, the surviving villages - Yam are evidence of which.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Legends and stories about the Mirzachol desert\"  src=\"images/legends-and-stories-about-the-mirzachol-desert.jpg\" title=\"Legends and stories about the Mirzachol desert\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Also in the records of the chronicler Abdul Gazi (the beginning of the XII century) information about the presence along the Syr Darya river settlements with developed agriculture preserved. In 1219 the hordes of Genghis Khan annihilated these towns and destroyed the irrigation canals. For many years life came to a standstill here. From the reports of Arab Ibn Batut, who traveled to Turkestan, it is clear that at this time near the Syr Darya River there were rare, very poor villages, the inhabitants, of which were predominantly the pastoralists.</p>

<p>Today in the Mirzachol there are collective farms, inter-farm enterprises, cooperatives, hundreds of peasant farms.</p>

<p>The abundance of warm and sunny days, long summers and mild winters beneficially effect on the whole agricultural sector. In the summer slovenly hot dry winds blow. &nbsp;They do not very favorable effect on farm crops. But this period does not last long. 247 days a year there are warm days.</p>

<h2>Mirzachol melons</h2>

<p>Famous Mirzachol melons which are notable for extremely sweet and delicate flavor are grown in the Golodnaya Steppe.</p>

<p>Mirzachol melon belongs to the late-ripening variety, the season of which is in August-September. Probably the most favorite melons by the Uzbek are big, sweet but not sugary, refreshing and saturating Mirzachol melons.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Mirzachol melons\"  src=\"images/mirzachol-melons.jpg\" title=\"Mirzachol melons\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>The flesh of melons contains a lot of useful substances: vitamins, minerals, carotene, folic acid, fiber and a lot of enzymes that improve the functioning of the bowels.</p>

<p>The melon pulp is juicy, bright white, has excellent taste, dropping-down and becoming stronger during storage.</p>

<p>Mirzachul melon is really a great product, about which one can talk a lot.</p>

<p>It is known, for certain, that the melons of the present Uzbekistan sort \"Mirzachol\" in the 17th and 18th century conquered many countries up to England.</p>

<p>Today travelers from over the world can visit Uzbekistan and taste famous delicious Mirzachul melons, and that is more important and interesting to book a tour to the Golodnaya Steppe in Uzbekistan.&nbsp;</p>

{{<h1>Kyzyl kum desert</h1>

<p>No mountains, no rocks, no roughness. Only a smooth cavity - a sheet of paper on which one could write all the books of the world.</p>

<h2>Kyzyl kum desert information</h2>

<p>The name \"Kyzylkum\" from Turkic can be translated as \"Red Sands\". Sands, formed by weathering and deflation indigenous sandy sediments have reddish color here.</p>

<p>The Kyzyl kum desert is a plain with remnant mountains, folded with rocks of the Paleozoic era. The most of it is occupied by sand dunes, extending a height of 3 to 75 meters, and close to the wells and towns there are loose barchan sands. The dunes, invading the <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/bukhara/sightseeing-in-bukhara/karakul-reserve.html\" title=\"Karakul\">Karakul</a> and Bukhara oases in the south of the Kyzyl kum desert are now secured with plantings of shrubs and trees. The plain area of the Kyzyl kum consists of Cenozoic clays and gritstones. In the north-west and north there are river sediment contains of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya channels, once guttering into the <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"aral-sea-tours/\" title=\"Aral Sea\">Aral Sea</a>.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Kyzyl kum desert in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/kyzyl-kum-desert-in-uzbekistan.jpg\" title=\"Kyzyl kum desert in Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>The surface of the Kyzyl kum desert has flat overall dip from the south-east to the north-west to the seashore of the Aral.</p>

<p>Throughout the Kyzyl kum desert there is no natural watercourse, only intermittent river called Zhanadarya. In the south-western and central part of the desert large artesian basins were found. Around dug wells on this territory there were areas of cultivation of melons, experimental stations for the investigation of farming and ranching opportunities in such conditions. Some of the Kyzyl kum desert is mastered by orchards, rice fields and vineyards.</p>

<h2>Kyzyl kum desert location</h2>

<p>The Kyzyl kum desert on the world map is marked as one of the large-scaled deserts of Eurasia, which stretches from the littoral of the Aral Sea in the north to the fertile oasis relatively narrow strip near the Zarafshan river in the south.</p>

<h2>Kyzyl kum desert climate</h2>

<p>The climate in the Kyzyl kum desert is acutely continental. Summer is sizzling hot, with the average temperature in July from 26 to 29 ° C, in winter, the January temperature is from 0 to -9 ° C.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Kyzyl kum desert climate\"  src=\"images/kyzyl-kum-desert-climate.jpg\" title=\"Kyzyl kum desert climate\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Here are little precipitation falls. The annual quantity of precipitations is on the average 150 mm, although in the mountain slopes they are a little more. Snow rarely falls here. On areas irrigated by waters of the Syr Darya and Amu Darya here wheat and cotton are grown. But high volatility contributes to the rapid salinization of soils, making it difficult to agriculture.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Kyzyl kum desert flora and fauna&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The climate is associated with Kyzyl kum desert flora and fauna. The Kyzyl kum desert animals are snakes, jerboas, lizards, black lizards, gazelles, squirrels, foxes, hares, eagles and owls; drought-resistant Kyzyl kum plants are saxaul, ferrule and camel thorn. Vegetation and animals are wonderfully adjusted to weather conditions of the Kyzyl kum desert, essentially, to the absence of water, extreme temperatures, strong hot winds. But by-turn, the biomass of the Kyzyl kum is higher than the biomass of the taiga, forest tundra and tundra. Most animals are lizards and rodents, but there are invertebrates and arachnids. And exactly during the periods of spring and autumn you can see its local inhabitants.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Kyzyl kum desert and the Great Silk Road&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Even in past years, the <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"combined-tours-to-central-asia.html\" title=\"Great Silk Road\">Great Silk Road</a> passed through the Kyzyl kum desert. Such cities as <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/samarkand/\" title=\"Samarkand\">Samarkand</a>, Khorezm, <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/bukhara/\" title=\"Bukhara\">Bukhara</a> were flourishing thanks to it. The caravan routes were not only from oasis to oasis and from bazaar to bazaar – the Silk Road connected the holy places and was like a nervous system in the human body.&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Tour in the Kyzylkum\"  src=\"images/tour-in-the-kyzylkum.jpg\" title=\"Tour in the Kyzylkum\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Cities had their own caravanserais, where goods were stored and people lived. Merchants from other countries came to these places for outlandish oriental goods. At these outlets many people of different professions were busy. They were moneychangers, translators, camel drivers, tax collectors, guards of the caravans. The ancient cities located around the Kyzyl kum are the pearls of red sands. Oddly enough, but the desert was in a full swing stormy life.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Kyzyl kum desert facts&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Many believe that in the Kyzyl kum desert except sands there is not look at that, but it is the incorrect view. Indeed, the desert conditions are quite severe, there are very little rains, and it is not suitable for anything. Nevertheless, people who were born and grew up in these parts, believe that there is no more beautiful place in the world.&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Kyzyl kum desert facts\"  src=\"images/kyzyl-kum-desert-facts.jpg\" title=\"Kyzyl kum desert facts\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>In addition the depths of the mountains in the Kyzyl kum desert in Uzbekistan are full of gold. These are unique mountains, the beauty of which will impress even the most experienced traveler. In the mountains marble, graphite, turquoise, etc are designed. Urana and phosphate deposits are in the center of the desert. The largest gas field - Gazly operates in the desert. Many towns and even big cities such as Zarafshan, Uchkuduk and <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/navoi/\" title=\"Navoi\">Navoi</a> are also in the desert.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Kyzyl kum is the desert, where a range of unexplored abnormal areas was found. For example, in the central Kyzyl kum the petroglyphs, which depict people in suits and something like spaceships were found. The witnesses of frequent visits of aliens are modern inhabitants of the desert.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Bactrian camels – “ships of the Kyzyl kum desert”&nbsp;</h2>

<p>For centuries the attributes have remained unchanged in the Kyzyl kum desert. They are yurts and camels - \"ships of the desert\"&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today going on travels on camels across the Kyzyl kum desert is of wide popularity. The Kyzyl kum is the most likely area of domestication of the Bactrian camel. Even the scientific name of the animal speaks of his Central Asian origin, as in ancient times the vast historic area along the middle and upper reaches of the main river edge - Amudarya were called Bactria. Peculiar books, engraved by our ancestors on the rocks helped scientists to recover the history of domestication of camels. They are, of course, the most ancient books, named drawings – petroglyphs, which were found in foothill areas of Central Asia, including the remains of the ancient hills in the Kyzyl kum desert.</p>

<p>During the tours round the Kyzyl kum desert you will be offered the acquaintance with nature and visits to yurts of nomads, where local dishes will be cooked for you and information regarding culture of nomadic tribes will be told you.</p>

<h2>The secrets of the Kyzyl kum desert</h2>

<p>Until now, about the culture and history of ancient Khorezm is known very little. The Kyzyl kum desert keeps the most of the material traces of its former magnificence. But the questions here are still far more than the answers to them, because the culture of the ruins of ancient Khorezm is yet poorly understood. Mostly they are in the Kyzyl kum desert. Supposedly, here are about 300 castles, to dig up which is not yet possible. But even some remains of the fortress tell of a highly developed civilization of ancient Khorezm. Koy-Krylgan-Kala fortress, which in S.P. Tolstoy’s judgment, the academician, was both a temple, dedicated to the star Fomalhaut, and the observatory.</p>

<h2>\"Stone Forest\" in the Kyzyl kum desert&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The Kyzyl kum desert keeps a lot of mysteries and findings.</p>

<p>One of these discoveries was the \"Stone Forest\" in the hole Dzharakuduk - a unique natural phenomenon. \"Stone Forest\" belongs to the Kyzyl kum desert, in a reserved part of Mingbulak basin (near the highway Uchkuduk - Nukus).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The literature sources reported about the \"buried dense forests at the root, which were located on the coasts of the ancient interbasin flows and estuary basins of the first half of the late cretaceous period. The prints of sycamore, laurel, magnolia and other angiospermous leaves, the remains of litter and tree waste, preserved in some places were found here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The researchers-naturalists affirm that near Dzharakuduk areas where many millions of years ago \"antediluvian forests\" grew, were autopsied. Later they were covered with layers of marine and river sediments. Wood mineralized and petrified, but fully retained its former appearance and structure. In the ancient soil layers, near Dzharakuduk, the Kyzyl kum area, some dinosaur bones were found.&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Kyzyl kum plants\"  src=\"images/kyzyl-kum-plants.jpg\" title=\"Kyzyl kum plants\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Today this place is well known and studied by scientists and geologists. Many sensational discoveries were done. In terms of diversity and quantity of finds there is no such a place in the world.</p>

<p>Among stone piles, cuts coastal and sea formations one can see stone structures, resembling the sound pipes of the Gothic organ. They are petrified trunks of the ancient forest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sections of groundwater deposits of the hole are indeed larded with the leftovers of organisms, among which fragments of skeletons of vertebrate animals and reptiles dominate. The collection of finds was replenished by a set of teeth of amphibians. The complex layers of fossils consist of layers of clay, freshwater and marine sediments, sandstones and other rocks. All mentioned above witnesses to the fact that the Kyzyl kum was once a unit of the World Ocean.&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Kyzylkum desert tour\"  src=\"images/kyzy-kum-desert-tour.jpg\" title=\"Kyzylkum desert tour\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>A man, who has never been in the Uzbek part of the Kyzyl kum, could hardly guess that there is a tourist infrastructure here. And it is, but non-standard - for lovers of adventure tourism. The main transports on the routes are jeeps, but you can go on a \"safari\" on a camel. Travelers who want to witness the Khorezm fortresses and desert landscapes in the Kyzyl kum become more and more every year.

{{<p align=\"right\">I strangled love and ruined it forever,</p>

<p align=\"right\">I cooled the sultry ardor by means of weird thoughts.</p>

<p align=\"right\">I put myself in evil chains whatever,</p>

<p align=\"right\">I turned into a desert – a dead waste Aralkum.</p>

<h1>Aralkum desert in Uzbekistan</h1>

<p>On our blue planet Earth there are many places, painted in yellow heat and drought, called the deserts. About a third of the land surface is made up of various types of sands with very little rainfall and vegetation. Some of them were formed naturally over millions of years, while others were just a couple of decades because of the reckless actions of a man.</p>

<p>But the most noted instance of this is the Aralkum desert - the desert, which appeared on the site of the once full-flowing salt lake in Central Asia under the name of the <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"aral-sea-tours/\" title=\"Aral Sea\">Aral Sea</a>.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Aralkum desert in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/sights/aralkum-desert-in-uzbekistan.jpg\" title=\"Aralkum desert in Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>The Aral Sea was one of the outsized inland closed brackish waters of the globe. The Aral Sea acted as the giant of the evaporator. About 60 cubic km of water evaporated from it and entered the atmosphere. Until 1960, the Aral was the fourth hugest inland lake on earth.</p>

<p>The sea with the value to Ireland evaporated for 90%. The storms of sand and salt have led to chronic conditions of local dwellers. And the Aral salt, driven by winds, according to scientists, are found in the Nordic countries and Japan.</p>

<h2>Now here is the Aral desert - Aralkum</h2>

<p>This sea-lake completely dried up, when a man violated its water balance, using lake waters for irrigation of vast agricultural areas. The area of the Aralkum, a man-made desert, is 38 thousand square kilometers, and continues to increase, although people are trying to return the Aral Sea.</p>

<p>The dried-up seabed turned into the sand and salt desert - Aralkum. This is a powerful source of wind and dust removal of salt - up to 100-150 million tons per year.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Aralkum tours\"  src=\"images/sights/aralkum-tours.jpg\" title=\"Aralkum tours\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Due to the abundance of salt the desert is sometimes called Akkum, which is translated as \"the white sands\".</p>

<h2>Versions of the rise of the Aralkum desert.</h2>

<p>There are several versions of Aral death. One of the original versions indicates that the sea was shallow due to the fact that the waters of the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, which flew into it, set aside for sewage cotton farms in large volumes.</p>

<p>Also, a group of geologists believes that the Caspian and the Aral Sea are joined with the underground channel through which water flows in one or the other direction: from the Aral Sea to the Caspian Sea, and vice-versa. It is believed that this depends on the Earth\'s rotation and solar activity.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Akkum\" src=\"images/sights/akkum.jpg\" title=\"Akkum\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>According to other researchers, the Amu Darya channel enters the earthquake zone. It is very likely that in these moments under the channel the voids are opened where the river \"drains\" the water.</p>

<p>And one of the advanced leads regarding the rise of the Aralkum desert indicates that the climate in Central Asia over the past 20 years has become drier.</p>

<h2>Aralkum flora and fauna</h2>

<p>40 years ago the Aral Sea was an oasis of freshness between two sands - the Karakum and the Kyzylkum. It was a huge body of water with a rich living world, with a huge biological diversity that could be compared with Africa.</p>

<p>Today the Aralkum flora is delineated by 423 species of plants which are among 44 families and 180 generas. The specific diversity of vegetation of sands, which is focused on the one-time islands of the east coast, is the highest.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Aralkum flora and fauna\"  src=\"images/sights/aralkum-flora-and-fauna.jpg\" title=\"Aralkum flora and fauna\" width=\"690\" /></div>br />

<p>The strip of the deserted Aral Sea is distinguished by a lower biodiversity than the coast. Among the plant species the coast of the Aral Sea 30 species are valuable fodder plants. Here are about 30 species of medicinal plants. Weeds are 31 species. More than 60 species of local flora are implicit fitomeliorants for drained coasts.</p>

<h2>Aralkum climate</h2>

<p>In the last 5-10 years, because of the desiccation process of the Aral Sea, the Aral Sea climate change is marked. Earlier the Aral acted as a regulator, mitigating the cold winds coming from Siberia and reducing, like a giant air-conditioning effect of heat in summer months. With the tightening of climate the summer has become more dry and short, winter has become more long and cold.</p>

<p>A distinctive feature of the Aralkum desert is a sharply continental climate. In the Aral Sea coastal areas the precipitation fell several times. Their value at an average is 150-200 mm with essential seasonal unevenness.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Aralkum climate\"  src=\"images/sights/aralkum-climate.jpg\" title=\"Aralkum climate\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>There is a high volatility with decreasing humidity of 10%. The air temperature became lower in the winter and increased in the summer by 2-3 ° C. In summer months there are high temperatures (up to +49 C). A typical feature of the Aralkum is the high frequency and long duration of dust storms and blizzards. Often there are strong winds in the Aral Sea area. The maximum wind speed can reach 20-25 m / s.</p>

<h2>The Aral Sea Crisis</h2>

<p>The Aral Sea will inevitably disappear in the beginning of the 21st century. This conclusion was drawn by an association of scientists and specialists from Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>The study of the history of the Aral Sea over the past 40 years has allowed the researchers to infer that the sea has dried half. The pond was divided into two - the Large Aral and Lesser Aral Seas. Ecosystems perished.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"White sands\"  src=\"images/sights/white-sands.jpg\" title=\"White sands\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Nevertheless, we have it from an unimpeachable historical source that the Aral Sea had dried out years ago and some day the desert Aralkum would vanish in the same way as it has appeared.</p>

<h2>Legends about the Aralkum desert</h2>

<p>Once, when the Aral Sea was a full-blown sea, it had a great deal of islands. Islands hid and hide today many legends and mysterious stories. The most interesting islands are the island of Rebirth (Vozrojdeniya), the island of Tolmachev, Barsakelmes Island and many others.</p>

<p>Till 1961, the Aral Sea had 1100 islands with the area of more than 1 hectare. Their total area before the drying was 2230 km2.</p>

<p>10 years later all the islands closed to each other, having formed the Aralkum desert.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Legends about the Aralkum desert\"  src=\"images/sights/legends-about-the-aralkum-desert.jpg\" title=\"Legends about the Aralkum desert\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>In Soviet times on the Island of Rebirth there was a firing ground for the manufacture and testing of biological weapons. Trials were carried out till the end of the 80s.</p>

<p>The island Barsakelmes has many stories. Barsakelmes got its name thanks to the strange phenomenon taking place on its territory. \"If you go – you will not come back\", such way sounds a translated name of the island.</p>

<p>People tell many stories that there were not isolated cases of missing people who later returned. However, there was one moment. Those people who were considered missing without a trace, suddenly declared over decades. According to the participants themselves they spent on the island for several days.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Aral desert of Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/sights/aral-desert-of-uzbekistan.jpg\" title=\"Aral desert of Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>A similar case occurred with the expedition of surveyors. Having come on the island, one part of the group went to work to its center. When the surveyors reached their destination, they switched on radio, however, the attempts to establish radio communication with the shore, were futile.</p>

<p>Communication was adjusted after about an hour, but as it turned out, for this time on the banks twenty-four hours passed and disappeared people have been already searched all over the island.</p>

<p>There is another story about a man in strange clothes, who was detained by a law enforcement officer. The prisoner spoke in a foreign language.</p>

<p>When the interpreter was invited all were amazed a story of the unusual man. He claimed that he was born in the XVII century. After the shipwreck the man was washed ashore, where he was detained. The argument to the veracity of his words was a rare dialect, spoken in the XVIII century, and the hapless sailor freely knew it.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Photos of Aralkum\"  src=\"images/sights/photos-of-aralkum.jpg\" title=\"Photos of Aralkum\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>In fact, most stories about Barsakelmes are based on unsubstantiated evidence, conjectures and legends. Many stories, most likely, are fiction, but local residents shun the mysterious terrain.</p>

<p>The Aral desert of Uzbekistan is a new phenomenon on the world map; and its fantastic landscapes inspire photographers and cameramen. Here, as nowhere else one acutely feels the frailty of earthly existence.</p>

<p>Tourists, guests of our country while using the services of Peopletravel Company can <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"uzbekistan-tours/\" title=\"order a tour around Uzbekistan\">order a tour around Uzbekistan</a>, including the Aralkum desert and watch the lost ships, piers in the middle of the desert, unpredictable and merciless winds and hundreds of kilometers of incandescent sands.</p>

The three-kilometer altitude mountain barrier Chimgan intercepts moisture falls from the winds crossing the desert, and the share of Bostanlyk goes up to 1000 millimeters of rain a year - three times more than in Tashkent. Here, as in the south of the Chatkal ridge, tangle of wild apple trees grow and the walnut groves adorn.</p>
<p>There are three large nature reserves on the territory of Uzbekistan mountains, particularly in the West Tien-Shan. They are Aksu-Djabagly, Sary-Chelek and Chatkal reserves.</p>

{{<h1>Alay mountains</h1>

<p>The Alay range - a mountain ridge in the south of the <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/ferghana-valley/\" title=\"Fergana region\">Fergana region</a> on the northern edge of the Alai valley that separates this valley from the parallel Trans-Alay mountains.</p>

<p>The Alay range is the watershed of the great Central Asian rivers - the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya. Right onflows of the Amu Darya (Vakhsh, Kafirnigan, Surkhan) originate in the Alay mountain system.</p>

<p>From west to east the Alay range has the length of 580 kilometers. The average height is about 4440 meters. Tamdykul peak (5539 m.) is the highest point in the Alay mountains.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Alay mountains Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/alay-mountains-uzbekistan.jpg\" title=\"Alay mountains Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>The Alay range begins in difficult mining site in the pass Suyak (Tuzbel), which the Fergana range and the Kokshaal-tau close up. Here the Alay mountains have the ridge of 4571 meters height on average.</p>

<p>The northern biases of the Alay range are gentle and form a series of longitudinal valleys; the southern slopes steeply fall to the Alay valley.</p>

<p>The crown of the Alay range is almost entirely covered with icing, the total space of which is 955 square kilometers.</p>

<p>On the slopes there are dry feather-grass and fescue steppes, meadow steppes, which give way to subalpine and highland meadow and glacial-nival (above 5000 m.) landscapes. In the gorges of the Alay mountains there are junipers, forests of walnut, almond, apricot. Here are about 200 passes, and Taldyk pass is one of the most eminent.</p>

<h2>Facts about the Alay mountains&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Because of its location the Alay range long since had drew the attention of geographers. Thus the German traveler of the XIX century Alexander von Humboldt called the Alay mountain range “Asfarakh”, a distorted formation from the name of the local river Isfara.&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Facts about the Alay mountains\"  src=\"images/facts-about-the-alay-mountains.jpg\" title=\"Facts about the Alay mountains\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Then A.P. Fedchenko, the Russian pathfinder nicknamed the Alay range the South Kokand ridge, because of the closeness to the Kokond Khanate. And only in 1876 after the military campaign of the general Skobelev the name “Alay range” went out of use.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>More facts about the Alay range</h2>

<p>Also V.F. Oshanin, the famous Russian explorer, geographer and naturalist made an expedition in the Alay valley. Oshanin crossed the Alay range through Archatdavan pass and went to the eastern area of the Alay valley. Here he separated from the expedition and climbed down the valley, passing it from east to west to the outfall of the river Kok-su.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Alay range\"  src=\"images/alay-range.jpg\" title=\"Alay range\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Then Oshanin climbed the pass Karakazyk and on the way to the Fergana valley for the second time he crossed the Alay range. Thus, he was the first who visited the Alay valley from end to end, except a small distance in the east. The most important result of his first major expedition was a detailed physical and geographical description of the Alay valley.</p>

<p>On personal observations and carefully collected data Oshanin gave the first outline of the morphology of the Alay range and information about its altitude snow line.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Alay valley</h2>

<p>The Alay valley, is one of the most vast intermountain basins in the country. The plain of the valley is little acclive to the west and is aligned along the central part. Along the tilt there is the river Kyzylsu. In the south side, in the foothills of the Trans-Alay Range there are hilly spurs consisting of ancient ocean deposits. The weather in the valley is sharp continental - dry and harsh.</p>

<h2>Natural attractions of the Alay mountains</h2>

<h3>Shakhimardan in the foothills of the Alay mountains, Uzbekistan</h3>

<p>Fifty km. southward of Fergana the road leads to Shakhimardan located in the Alay mountain range, Uzbekistan. Beyond Shakhimardan there are grazing lands, proprietorships of shepherds and gamebirds.</p>

<p>\"Shahimardan\" is translated as \"proprietor of the people\", which is mapped to the name of Khazrat Ali. In the Muslim world he is considered the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. And according to popular legends one of his seven graves is in this town.</p>

<p>The small and not populous (5 thousand of inhabitants) village of the Alay range is a tiny island of Uzbekistan, surrounded with the Batkesk area of Kyrgyzstan. It came to pass that in the 30 years the village went to Uzbekistan, and now from this tiny enclave up to the \"big land\" there are almost 17 kilometers in the around of the adjoining state.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Shakhimardan in the foothills of the Alay mountains\"  src=\"images/shakhimardan-in-the-foothills-of-the-alay-mountains.jpg\" title=\"Shakhimardan in the foothills of the Alay mountains\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>There is another interesting moment in the history of Shakhimardan. In Soviet period Shakhimardan some time was called Khamzaabad, in honor of Khamza Khakim-zade Niyazi - the poet and the initiator of the Uzbek dramatic art. Here in 1929, March, religious zealots stoned to death the Uzbek poet. In the 60-s in tribute to the great figure of literature the museum and mausoleum of Khamza were built. In 1989 a new museum and a monument were unveiled in Shakhimardan.</p>

<p>Shakhimardan in the Alay mountains is an incredibly beautiful place. It\'s hard to discover a place prettier throughout the Fergana valley, and Uzbekistan as a whole. Shakhimardan conveniently lies on the northern slopes of the Alay range. From both sides it is washed by the Ok-Su and Kok-Su rivers. They merge and form the Shakhimardan-sai.</p>

<p>The waters of these rivers are pristine and at the bottom you can see the floating fish. Here are good recreation centers, where with a conductor it is possible to conquer the mountains. In the Alay mountains it is quite possible to find out the paths and plants that have not been met by you, listen to the chirping of birds, watch the mating games of hawks, gather pistachios and swim in the clear mountain water, which treats many ailments, and you will feel re-born.</p>

<h2>Kurban-Kul Lake or the Blue Lake in the Alay mountains</h2>

<p>In 7 kilometers south-west of Shakhimardan the Blue Lake (Kurban-Kul - \"Sacrificial lake\") is located. In 1766, collapsed in previous times the mass of rocks on the right bank of the river Karasu created a natural dike, having dammed the river and formed the Blue Lake.</p>

<p>As the local legend tells, the villagers were punished for their sins and buried under the rubble. Shakhimardan and the Blue Lake are the places of active Muslim pilgrimage and mountain tourism. It is also an amazing place for making trekking trips up the Alay range.</p>

<p>At the base of the natural dam from the left port side of the lake in its tailrace reach the powerful spring with the debit of more than 1,000 liters per second comes out.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Kurban-Kul Lake or the Blue Lake in the Alay mountain\"  src=\"images/kurban-kul-lake-or-the-blue-lake-in-the-alay-mountain.jpg\" title=\"Kurban-Kul Lake or the Blue Lake in the Alay mountain\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>The Blue Lake in the Alay mountains is at a height of 1724 meters above-sea level. The length of the lake is 170 meters, the expanse is 60 meters and a depth is 5-10 meters. In summer time the temperature of water reaches 5-10 degrees. The Blue Lake and Shakhimardan itself, is a very scenic and vivid place.</p>

<p>At 100-200 meters above the Blue Lake another small lake, known as \"Green Lake\" is situated</p>

<p>Healing mountain air, splendid nature, rapid rivers and charming expanse of the lake turn Shakhimardan into a favorite holiday spot for inhabitants of Uzbekistan, and a desirable object for inveterate tourists.&nbsp;</p>

{{<h1>Chatkal range</h1>

<p>From the&nbsp;Talas Ala-Too, the main ridge of the Western Tien-Shan all major mountain ranges branch off. The largest Chatkal range is limiting the <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/ferghana-valley/\" title=\"Fergana region\">Fergana region</a> from the North-West. Almost closed on all sides, the Fergana Valley from the north is bordered by the Chatkal and Kuraminskii ranges.</p>

<p>The Chatkal mountain range with numerous ridges forms a vast and difficult terrain on the mountain ridge, stretching nearly 200 km. with the highest point of 4503 m. (Chatkal peak).</p>

<p>The Chatkal range is snow cones, grandiose vertical slopes, stretching in deep canyons, peaks and towers. Above all this the high rocky peak with horizontal white stripes on the north slope rises. Numerous counterforces, while sliding, formed a system of mesas.</p>

<p>The dissected of the topography generated climatic differences, depending on the altitude, direction of ridges and ravines, and the exposure of their slopes. From November to May there is snow at altitudes more than 2000 meters. Glaciers usually are on the northern slopes. Each valley differs from the adjacent one with unique and inimitable rivers. They run from the mountain heights to the valley, forming the cascades of waterfalls and lakes.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Chatkal range Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/chatkal-range-uzbekistan.jpg\" title=\"Chatkal range Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Climate diversity that is characteristic for mountains creates the extraordinary variety of nature. At that time, as the northern slopes of the Chatkal range are shipped back in the winter dormancy and barely covered with the low rays of the sun, the southern slopes are already pleasing to the eye of a young green, and the first spring flowers.</p>

<p>In spring and autumn period the Chatkal mountain range attracts climbers and mountain tourists. Here it is available to carry out ascents of varying complexity degrees, as well as to make multi-day trekking along the Chatkal mountain range, for example, to the mysterious plateau Pulatkhan.</p>

<p>The Chatkal range in <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/tashkent/\" title=\"Tashkent region\">Tashkent region</a> also attracts numerous vacationers from different cities of Uzbekistan and abroad. Here are many holiday hotels and dachas, where you can enjoy resting and wonderful nature.</p>

<h2>Vegetable and animal worlds of the Chatkal range</h2>

<p>At the foothills of the fertile sierozems of the Chatkal range mixed grass steppes are highly developed. On the brown mountain-forest soils, there are wild rose bushes, barberry, honeysuckle and woody vegetation - almond, pistachio, hawthorn, maple, ash, walnut, apple, plum, pear, juniper, and others. Along the flood plains there are thickets of birches, willows, poplars as well as brambles, sea-buckthorn, raspberries, currants, sometimes wild vine. At a height of 2700 meters there are subalpine and alpine meadows. And above 3200-3500 meters high one can observe a desert with separate lawns of sedges, gentian among the moraine deposits of small glaciers and preserved snowfields.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Vegetable and animal worlds of the Chatkal range\"  src=\"images/vegetable-and-animal-worlds-of-the-chatkal-range.jpg\" title=\"Vegetable and animal worlds of the Chatkal range\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Fauna in the Chatkal mountain range is very specific and abundant. In the woods among the wild fruit trees and bushes there are wild boars, foxes, bears, deer. The forests are inhabited by the porcupine, badger and forest dormouse. Near the rocks stone marten, sometimes weasel and least weasel take shelter. High up in the mountains the Siberian goats graze, followed by hunting snow leopards. Everywhere in the Chatkal mountain range there are marmots. Deciduous forests are rich with starlings, orioles, blackbirds, woodpeckers, goldfinches and nightingales. On the rocks and steep slopes blue-gray doves, swifts and many birds of prey nest: They are vultures, kestrels, griffons, golden eagle and others. And stone placers are favorite places of chukars and snowcocks. The mountain rivers are commonly found three species of fish - marinka, Amudarya loach and Turkestan sheatfish.</p>

<h2>Natural reserves of the Chatkal range</h2>

<p>In the north-western and south-western slopes of the ridge there is Chatkal State Biosphere Reserve.</p>

<p>Chatkal Biosphere Reserve was organized in 1947. The administration building, located in<br />
Parkent, has a small museum. The branches of the Chatkal range are visible near Parkent. The reserve territory consists of 2 sections - Bashkyzylsay and Maydantal. Bashkyzylsay is located in the south-western slopes of the Chatkal range at altitudes of 1100-3247 meters, the second is situated on the remote northern slopes at altitudes of 1200-3800 meters. Maydantal district is remote from the first one of more than 30 kilometers. The restricted area of the reserve is located on the left bank of the river Serkelisay and is adjacent from the west to Maidantal site.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Natural reserves of the Chatkal range\"  src=\"images/natural-reserves-of-the-chatkal-range.jpg\" title=\"Natural reserves of the Chatkal range\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Chatkal Reserve was founded to protect mountain juniper forests, rare and endangered species of animals and plants. Currently 1004 species of grass, trees and shrubs grow in Bashkyzylsay area, including more than 200 species of medicinal plants and 84 rare species, which are listed in the Red Book of Uzbekistan. Among them there are tulips of Greig and Kaufman, soap root, Pskem onion and Koopman euonymus. The reserve is inhabited by 18 species of rare animals included to the list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. They are the snow leopards, marmots of Menzbir, black vultures, kestrels and brown pigeons. Habitation in the nature reserve of rare animals, imposes on the reserve a special responsibility for the preservation of these unique animals. Environmental and scientific activities of the reserve won the international recognition.</p>

<p>In the south-eastern slope of the Chatkal range there is Sary-Chelek State Biosphere Reserve, which has the status of the biosphere reserve of UNESCO since 1979.</p>

<p>The Reserve was organized in 1960. Its area is about 21 thousand hectares. Its extension is 20-25 km., the width is up to 12 km. In the upper part of the reserve there are narrow, deep gorges, over which the rocky peaked tops pinnacle rise. Among steep precipitous slopes snowfields are encountered. Alpine vegetation goes down in high grasslands and shrubs, where spruce, fir, juniper, broad-leaved trees grow. The lower part of the reserve is occupied with nut forests, alternating with thickets of shrubs.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Chatkal mountain range\"  src=\"images/chatkal-mountain-range.jpg\" title=\"Chatkal mountain range\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>The fauna is not less rich and varied. There are 41 types of mammals, 157 species of birds, 5 types of reptiles, 2 species of amphibians and 5 kinds of fish. Large animals are wild boars, deer, white-clawed bears, lynxes, badgers and porcupines. In the upper part of the reserve mountain goats and sheep, weasels, stone martens inhabit; snow leopards and wolves can be seen. In rocky areas of the reserve located on the Chatkal range one can see snowcocks and partridges, swallows, swifts, thrushes; above there are golden eagles, white-haired vultures, bearded vultures, griffons and Egyptian vultures. Particularly floodplains overgrown with forests and thick bushes are rich in birds. Cormorants, various ducks, herons, ospreys dwell in the area of lakes. In the rivers and lakes there are marinka, recently released European carps, carps, Amudarya trout. On the banks of water bodies one can meet green toads, lake frogs, water snakes. And in the forest belt there are patterned snakes and the only venomous snake of the reserve - copperhead snake.</p>

<h2>Facts about the Chatkal range</h2>

<p>To the north of the Chatkal range the Chatkal river flows. It falls into Charvak reservoir near the village Brichmulla.</p>

<p>In dozens kilometers eastward of Tashkent Chatkal foothills begin. The Chatkal range is a watershed of two major river basins. Its north-western slopes originate in the Chatkal river and its tributaries; its south-eastern slopes, directed to the Fergana Valley, feed the mountain streams that flow into the rivers Naryn and Syr Darya.</p>

<p>The Chatkal range has a decisive influence on the water regime of the Chirchik river, feeding mainly at the expense of Chatkal waters. Extremely dry climate and absence of rains in summer do mountain streams of glacier and snow descent the main source of water supply of the Tashkent region and major hydropower and industrial center on the river Chirchik.</p>

<p>In addition to that, the Chatkal mountain range has the favourable influence upon the climate of the northeastern part of Fergana, delaying the moist south-western winds and contributing to precipitation.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Facts about the Chatkal range\"  src=\"images/facts-about-the-chatkal-range.jpg\" title=\"Facts about the Chatkal range\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>The initial researches of the Chatkal refer to the 70-th years of the last century. When in 1864 Russian troops moved on Dzhambul, the naturalist N.A. Severtsov, seeked the resolution to partake in this campaign. He contrived to make a number of <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/tashkent/\" title=\"mountain tours\">mountain tours</a>, in particular, to penetrate through the pass Kara-bura in the valley of the Chatkal river. He went down the valley for 45 kilometers, and then the researcher in the same way climbed up back. N.A. Severtsov gave a minute description of Kara-bura pass, Kara-kasmak gorge and middle stream of the river Chatkal.</p>

<p>In 1874 and 1875 I.V Mushketov visited the Chatkal valley. From the village Brichmulla, he went into the upper reaches of the river Pskem where through the pass Kul- ashu he descended into the Chatkal valley near the village Idris-Peychamber (now the regional center of Yangi-Bazaar). Hence Mushketov traveled about 120 kilometers to the mouth of the river Kara-kasmak and further through Kara-bura pass he walked down the valley of the river Talas.</p>

<p>In 1911 the Austrian geographer Makhachek visited the valley Chatkal. He crossed the western part of the Chatkal range and was in the upper river heads of the Aflatun.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Chatkal mountain range trekking\"  src=\"images/chatkal-mountain-range-trekking.jpg\" title=\"Chatkal mountain range trekking\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>However, the fundamental attention of the researches was focused on the western part of the Chatkal range, which is more interesting because of its natural resource. Botanical and zoological expeditions also investigated the southern slopes of the Chatkal range and the lake Sary-chilek. Inaccessible headwaters of the east high part of the ridge remained unexplored.</p>

<p>Climbers’ attention to the area was attracted with the expedition led by N.N. Adelung and E.S. Levin, organized in 1933. The return journey of the expedition passed through the Chatkal valley. The distinctive beauty of the ridge tops prompted Levin to take a tour to the gorge Arpa-tokty to the highest point of the Chatkal range. Scenic areas and its small study made the group of S.M. Lukomskoy, V.I. Sapozhnikov and K.I. Ivanov head in the Chatkal range in 1940. The main expedition was planned for 1941, but the war prevented its realization. Only in 1945 mountaineers again headed in the Chatkal.</p>

<h2>Geographical location of the Ugam range</h2>

<p>The Ugam range is a mountain ridge in the Tien-Shan mountain system, located at the border of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Geographical location of the Ugam range\"  src=\"images/geographical-location-of-the-ugam-range.jpg\" title=\"Geographical location of the Ugam range\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Among the main branches of the Talas Alatau the Ugam range is the extreme western, which is rising as a high barrier above the Pskem valley. Under the name “Ugam” this range is stretching from the river mouth Pskem till the mountain junction in the Aksu river head, being the watershed of the Pskem and Ugam on the one side; and the Pskem and the upper course of the Arysi from the other side.</p>

<h2>Scientific research facts about the Ugam range</h2>

<p>The length of the Ugam range is 115 kilometers. Sayram mountain is the highest point (4238 meters; 4299 meters – according other dates). The medium mountain heights of the Ugam range in Uzbekistan are sizeable enough. They are fluctuating to 3518 meters on the passes and to 3928 meters on the crests. The steep slopes of the Ugam range only near the river are forming the hilly terraces which are broken down with deep cross gorges.</p>

<p>In the area of Sayram mountain in the sources of the Anaulgan river the Ugam range also carries the largest clusters of snow and ice streams.</p>

<p>The Ugam range is mainly folded from the sedimentary rocks (particular, limestones) and granitoid intrusions.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Scientific research facts about the Ugam range\"  src=\"images/scientific-research-facts-about-the-ugam-range.jpg\" title=\"Scientific research facts about the Ugam range\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>On the slopes the vegetation is mainly subtropical, semi-desert and steppe. In the valleys of the Ugam range there are deciduous forests; and in the region of highland there are meadow steppes and alpine grasslands.</p>

<p>In Ugam travelers can be interested in hiking, trekking tours or engage in rafting and kayaking down the Ugam river.</p>

<p>The weather in Ugam is always mild and cool. The Ugam range close to <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/tashkent/\" title=\"Tashkent\">Tashkent</a> is a favourite recreation place among Uzbek population and guests of the country.

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Ugam range\"  src=\"images/ugam-range.jpg\" title=\"Ugam range\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Moreover, the water in the Ugam river is considered to be healthy. In the mouth of the river there is a radon source. In the field of formation of the mainstream, the Ugam runs in rock fractures where from the bowels of the earth outside radon gas escapes. Radon is a radioactive inert gas and its concentration in the water of the Ugam river that is flowing near Khumsan and Khodjikent settlements, is healing.</p>

<p>The Ugam river together with the Pskem, flows down to the Charvak reservoir.</p>

<h2>Ugam Chatkal State National Reserve</h2>

<p>On the spurs of the Western Tien-Shan there is Ugam Chatkal State National Reserve. The reserve was established in 1990. The area of the park is 574,6 thousand hectares.</p>

<p>For lovers of mountain flora the Western Tien Shan is an attractive destination due to the great diversity of flora. Not less than 2200 plant species are found here - from Turan desert flora to the alpine flora of Pamir-Alai. Most of them belong to the angiosperms - 2150 species.</p>

<p>Fossil riches of Angren-Almalyk district were known in ancient times. The extraction started here in the Bronze Age. Traces of mountain crafts were found in many places in the form of hundreds of abandoned mines, huge dumps of mines, slag mountains, ruins of mine settlements and ancient towns. Karamazar ore district had been known since ancient times - from the V century BC. In the VIII-X centuries AD mining is developing rapidly due to the beginning of the growth of lead-silver and gold deposits. In ancient mine Lashkarek in the Qurama mountains (2500 meters above sea level) a large ancient metallurgical point was discovered. There are some underground mines at a depth of 300 m., and taken out of them, the amount of rock and ore is estimated at about 300 thousand cubic meters.</p>

<h2>Relief and vegetation of the Qurama range</h2>

<p>On the Qurama range the middle relief is dominating. At an altitude of 2300 meters there are coniferous and deciduous forests, juniper woodlands, walnuts grow on the northern slopes; here are alpine meadows and fescue steppes and on the lower slopes there are steppes and xerophilous bushes.</p>

<p>The slopes are poorly dissected: the valleys of the south - eastern slopes have elevation changes of about 1000 meters with extent of 25 - 40 kilometers. Rivers of the north-western slope flow in the river Akhangaran; rivers of the south - eastern slope are earmarked for irrigation and do not reach the Syr Darya.</p>

<p>There is no glaciation on the Qurama range; in the upper reaches of the gorges and the highest peaks there are snow fields. Alpine meadows occupy the zone, adjoining to the crest of the Qurama range.</p>

<p>Deep drop between the Qurama range on the south side and the western part of the Chatkal ridge is occupied by the valley of the Angren river, flowing from the Angren plateau.</p>

<p>There are more than 20 simple passes of 2000 to 3172 meters height (Kensaz pass). In large areas traverse along the crest of the ridge can be met.</p>

<h2>Historical facts about the Qurama mountains</h2>

<p>In the XVI-XVIII centuries the valley of Angren and the Qurama mountain range were the scene of numerous clashes between various militant groups that claimed power in the Fergana valley and in Tashkent. Among them there were troops of Shaybanid and then Ashtarhanid rulers, Kazakh sultans, units of local tribal chiefs and various mercenaries. Fightings were accompanied by population movements, the expulsion of some residents and resettlement of others in their place. So in one of the gorges the appearance of the military unit and its power attempt to establish themselves here looks plausible at oshobin tradition.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the XIX century, the residents of the Qurama mountains were “famous” not only for looting caravans that came from Tashkent to <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/ferghana-valley/\" title=\"Ferghana\">Ferghana</a> and back, but also for active participation in sectarian strifes. So, the Qurama foothills were in the midst of hostilities between the Kokand ruler Alimkhan and Tashkent ruler Yunus-Hoja.<br />
<br />
In Akhangaran valley, at the foothills and mountains of the Qurama range large recreation areas are created Clean air, mountains, juniper and birch forests, clear streams and waterfalls attract tourists and vacationers at any time of rest.</p>

{{<h2>Pskem range, Uzbekistan: general description</h2>

<p>The Pskem range – a range in the Western Tien-Shan, at the border of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. The length of the Pskem range is 160 kilometeres; the range adjoins to the Talas Alatau. The primary peaks of the Pskem range are Beshtor (4299 m.), Aktyu-yaulgen (4224 m.), Tavalgan (3888 m.) and Piazak (3718 m.).</p>

<p>The total glaciations area is about 70 square kilometers. There are about 100 of glaciers. The high level of the snowline on the north-western slopes is 3700 – 3800 meters; on the south-eastern slopes – about 4000 meters.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Pskem range, Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/pskem-range-uzbekistan.jpg\" title=\"Pskem range, Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>On the sides of the Pskem range there are subalpine and alpine grasslands, at an altitude above 3500 m. there are nival landscapes.</p>

<p>On the Pskem range and its spurs there are about 60 passes. The height of the spurs is from 2200 till 3800 meters.</p>

<p>The crests of the main and side ridges are narrow and rocky; the peaks are sharp-pointed; the slopes are steep and broke up with deep gorges and gullies. The rocky precipices, hillside wastes and accumulation of large stones substantially hamper the movement.</p>

<h2>Climate of the Pskem range</h2>

<p>Winter in the Pskem mountain range is overcast, cold and snowy. The temperature reaches to 15°. In spring there is the abundance of rains, at night sometimes there are frosts and snows. Daytime temperature reaches up to + 15 °.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Climate of the Pskem range \"  src=\"images/climate-of-the-pskem-range.jpg\" title=\"Climate of the Pskem range \" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>&nbsp;Summer in the lower reaches of the river is hot and dry, in the upper tiers of the mountains the climate is cool. Rains are rare in summer, but snow in the upper reaches of the river at the ridge tops of the Pskem range does not melt all year round, and forms here small areas of permafrost – snowfields and glaciers. Autumn is dry and cold. Frosts can begin in the middle of September, and snow falls in middle of October and is more stable in the upper zones of mountains.</p>

<h2>Vegetable and animal world of the Pskem range</h2>

<p>Near the human activity the lands are occupied by garden and vegetable crops - orchards and vineyards, walnut plantations along the banks of rivers and streams.</p>

<p>The slopes of the Pskem range of Tashkent region are abundantly covered with vegetation. Here are wild fruit trees and shrubs. The river banks are occupied by Central Asian juniper, poplar thickets.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Vegetable and animal world of the Pskem range\"  src=\"images/vegetable-and-animal-world-of-the-pskem-range.jpg\" title=\"Vegetable and animal world of the Pskem range\" width=\"689\" /></div><br />

<p>Human activities can also be deeply observed in the mountains – as a kind of set apiaries and shepherd lands.</p>

<p>In the valley of the river Pskem there are white-clawed bears. On tributaries of Maydantal and Oygaing one can meet wolves. Tien Shan fox, marmot, a stone marten inhabit the valley. In the Pskem river basin there are Turkestan lynx and snow leopard. Practically far and wide, one can meet the wild boar and the badger. Many birds live in the Pskem mountains. In the herbaceous slopes there are wild turkeys and mountain partridges. Golden eagles, bearded vultures, Egyptian vultures nest in the rocks.</p>

<h2>Rivers of the Pskem range</h2>

<p>In the Chirchik river basin the Pskem range acts as the main watershed between the rivers Pskem with the left tributary of the Oygaing and Chatkal with the right tributary of the Chandalash. The rivers have rocky bottom with many rapids; in some areas there are continuous rifts, the banks are rocky. The rivers do not freeze all year round.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Rivers of the Pskem range\"  src=\"images/rivers-of-the-pskem-range.jpg\" title=\"Rivers of the Pskem range\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>From the slopes of the Pskem range, within the country, numerous powerful says and mountain rivers stream down. They are Aksarsay, Mashtosgonsay, Ispay, Minjilki, Kaptarkumush, Badaksay, Pskemsay, Ikhnachsay, Djamaltor, Beshtor, Tunduksay, Koksu, Baykyraksay, Aktapchigay, Tastarsay and Shabyrsay. Only the western slopes of the Pskem range are within Uzbekistan.</p>

<h2>Pskem river</h2>

<p>The river Pskem itself is typically mountainous, with swift movements and a significant debit. It does not freeze in winter. The route from the Pskem mouth to the last village Pskem is more than thirty-five kilometers away, and all along here there are orchards, vineyards, agricultural crops and etc. Approximately in the middle of this distance, on the left bank of the Pskem, at the outfall of the mountain Ispaysay a small village Ispay lies.</p>

<h2>Sights of the Pskem range</h2>

<p>The attraction in Ispaysay river region is a great scenic \"circus\" formed by ridges, spurs and rocky areas of the Pskem range. It is easily visible from the upper part of Surhat hole. This “circus” has its own unique beauty: blanket green coverlets surround rocks with snow, forming the unforgettable and landscape pleasing to the eye.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Sights of the Pskem range\"  src=\"images/sights-of-the-pskem-range.jpg\" title=\"Sights of the Pskem range\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Here, in one of the rocky ledges, among small caves, nature created an unusual conglomerate stone-pillar. And in the riverhead of the Makarsaya there is small juniper, among which there are instances of a venerable age. The abundance of snowfields, glaciers and mountain passes of the Pskem range make this area particularly attractive for sports tourism, including trekking, hiking and climbing.</p>

<p>In the upper sources of the Mulalasay, falling into the Pskem river (near Mulala village) fossil remains of sea animals were discovered.</p>

<h2>Ispay</h2>

<p>Ispaysay takes its origin in the high and snow Pskem range, where all the year round at altitudes above 3000 - 3500 meters above sea level is snow. Nearest highest peaks are \"Piezak\" (3736) and \"Padar\" (3564). And such mountain passes as Ispay (3485 m), Padar (3330 m), Abdar (3415 m), Tashkent (3495 m), Mathematics (3420 m), Piezak lojniy (3620 m), Piezak (3420 m) lead to the basin river Koksu in its middle stream. These routes are quite serious and are intend for well-trained and equipped tourists.</p>

<h2>Facts about the Pskem range</h2>

<p>Altogether, on the territory of the Tien-Shan there are more than 8000 glaciers. The area of glaciers is 7.3 thousand square kilometers. Fresh water that is preserved in the mountain glaciers is estimated at 650 billion meters. During the period of 1960-2005 on the Trans-Ili Alatau mountains about 100 glaciers disappeared; glaciation area of the Western Tien-Shan (Pskem mountain range) decreased by 16.8% over 20 years.</p>

<h2>Other historical facts about the Pskem mountains</h2>

<p>The mountaineering opening up of the Pskem range started at the beginning of the 80-s.</p>

<p>In June of 1982 in Ispay thanks to endeavours of trainers-instructors of <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/tashkent/\" title=\"Tashkent\">Tashkent</a> section the camp-out for Uzbek alpinists was organized. Consequently, the routes of almost all peaks of “circuses” and Duvalisurh (from 1B to 5B complexity degrees) were passed. Unfortunately, the classification of the routes had not been carried out up to the end, so they are few in the Classifier.</p>

{{<h1>Pulatkhan plateau</h1>

<p>The Pulatkhan plateau in Uzbekistan is a mesa in the north-western spurs of the <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"about-uzbekistan/uzbekistan-mountains/chatkal-range.html\" title=\"Chatkal range\">Chatkal range</a>, of the western part of the Middle Tien-Shan.</p>

<h2>Pulatkhan plateau facts</h2>

<p>The Pulatkhan plateau close to <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"uzbekistan-cities/tashkent/\" title=\"Tashkent\">Tashkent</a> is situated 11 kilometers to the south-east from the top of the Big Chimgan. From here this small flat area of the irregular triangular shape is stretching from the southeast to the northwest for a distance of about 5 kilometers. The total area of the plateau is about 8 square kilometers.</p>

<p>North-east and south-east sides of the Pulatkhan mountains are steep discharge to the rivers Terekli and Kara-Archa. The third side of this conditional triangle can be divided into two parts, and then the south-eastern half of the plateau will be steep and precipitous, and the south-western half will descend to the Azalsay.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Pulatkhan plateau facts\"  src=\"images/pulatkhan-plateau-facts.jpg\" title=\"Pulatkhan plateau facts\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>The maximum height of the Pulatkhan mountain is 2823 meters, the minimum one is about 2600 meters. Though from the top of the Big Chimgan the exterior of the plateau seems surprisingly smooth, it is not so. The Pulatkhan plateau has an overall slope in a northwestern direction; moreover, different parts have also different inclinations in ratio of each other.</p>

<p>Having a rather small area, the Pulatkhan mountain is literally detached from the surrounding mountain world by steep and almost inaccessible rocky cliffs. The whimsical relief of the Pulatkhan plateau, its little-known geological past and isolated from foreign influence flora and fauna attract mountain tourists and investigators. Mstislav Nikolaevich Korelov was the first research worker, who in 1948 visited the plateau. It was the only expedition, which carried out serious faunal study of the area, covered with rumors and myths.</p>

<p>The most noted, the most profound and the most complex cave of the plateau Pulatkhan is certainly the cave of Alexander Zaidman. Although the entry to the cave was found in the early 80-s of the last century, it was formally opened in 1988, during the expedition led by Novosibirsk speleological club under the leadership of S.Safonov. From 1988 to 1991, the cave was being explored by 6 expeditions.</p>

<h2>Pulatkhan plateau history</h2>

<p>The origin of the name of the historic plateau Pulatkhan, according to folk etymology, has two versions. The first version tells that the name arises from the shepherd’s name Pulat, who was hiding from the evil bai on the Pulatkhan mountain with his bride named Oyim.</p>

<p>The second version originated from the name that was got by the leader of the rebels - Iskhak Mullah. At the beginning of 1873 in the Kokand Khanate the insurrection against the yoke of the ruler Khudoyar - Khan broke out. The uprising was led by Iskhak Mullah Khasan oglu, who operated under the assigned name Pulat-bek. After a series of battles and betrayals Pulat-bek was proclaimed Khan, but soon he was forced to flee to the Chatkal mountains to collect forces. By the time the uprising acquired not only anti-feudal traits but anti-Russian ones. In December 1875 Pulatkhan with 80 thousand army set out against Russian troops. At night from 27 on 28 of January, 1876 between Andijan and Namangan his army was utterly defeated by troops under the command of General Skobelev; and Pulatkhan was hanged in March of the same year.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Pulatkhan plateau history\"  src=\"images/pulatkhan-plateau-history.jpg\" title=\"Pulatkhan plateau history\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Situated among the mountain ranges the mysterious Pulatkhan plateau is a unique natural object, which is covered with legends.</p>

<p>One of the closest to the historical realities is a narrative about the Turkic Khan Pulat, who, during the invasion of Genghis Khan brought to the plateau all his men and stood the siege of the Mongols there for a few years. The enigmatic Pulatkhan plateau is a natural fortress, the path to which leads along the open ridge. In that case, people who approached the plateau were a good target for bowmen.</p>

<p>25 centuries ago the great commander and statesman Alexander the Great began his march through the countries of Central Asia. But freedom-loving peoples of Bactria and Sogdiana were unwilling to submit to the conqueror, and revolted. According to one legend, in the cave of one of the conquered alpine fortresses Alexander hid his treasures. His beloved concubine, fell in love with Alexander’s companion. Alexander allowed them both to stay and live in one of the caves. And to this day it is believed that the souls of two young men roam about the highland plateau Pulatkhan, named after the cruel, but just ruler.</p>

<p>Another legend about the Pulatkhan plateauis associated with countless riches supposedly hidden by Pulatkhan in the cave. The Plateau is really of karstic origin and it has many craters, and within the walls there are small depressions - grottos. But for the time being only one entrance to the cave has been found. It recedes with vertical wells into a depth of over 500 meters.</p>

<h2>Animal world of the Pulatkhan plateau</h2>

<p>In the Pulatkhan mountains one can often hear a sharp and shrill whistle. It is the marmot of Menzbir - endemic of the Western Tien-Shan. The marmot lives in the highlands, it prefers places near the large snowfields, where often there is a thick layer of soil and moisture-loving vegetation. Marmots are listed in the International and National Red Book and are in need of strict protection.</p>

<p>On the stony rocky cliffs of the Pulatkhan plateau one can find a full inhabitant of rocky highlands - mountain or Siberian goats. This remarkable animal luxurious with horns dwells in inaccessible rocky areas at altitudes from 1500 to 3500 meters. Mountain goats confidently move to the mountains where no any animal can pass. In case of danger goats always look for shelter in the rocks, where they have a rest during the heat of summer.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Animal world of the Pulatkhan plateau\"  src=\"images/animal-world-of-the-pulatkhan-plateau.jpg\" title=\"Animal world of the Pulatkhan plateau\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>During a travel to the Pulatkhan plateau from the mountain Karangur or Pulatkhan one can almost without binoculars see Himalayan griffon - a large highland bird of prey living near the borders of the eternal snows. With unusual speed and ease it hovers over the mountain tops, soaring higher and higher. On the Pulatkhan mountain 49 varieties of birds were marked. Among them the most interesting are slender-billed lark, Indian chiffchaff, wallcreeper, brambling, juniper lentil, alpine jackdaw.</p>

<p>On all sides the edges of the Pulatkhan plateau drop off in the canyon with the ledges of more than 1 kilometer height. It is possible to get to the plateau only through a narrow path sufficient for passage of one person. This place is called \"Pulathandarvoza\" (Pulatkhan gates). The panorama of Pulatkhan plateau is incredibly beautiful. It opens to the surrounding mountains and rivers</p>

<p>In the middle of the Pulatkhan plateau a small stream with no flow runs. Water seeps into the bowels and pulls out of the walls by lots of waterfalls. The stones on the plateau under the influence of water, sun, frost and wind acquired a bizarre shape. In the rocks there are many grottos and, apparently, there is an extensive system of karstic caves. Once in the caves ascetics settled.</p>

<p>So far, the rare groups of speleologists who dared to trek to the Pulatkhan plateau, could not satisfy their curiosity or sufficiently explore its mysterious wells and corridors, partly filled with icy water of mountain rivers.</p>

{{<h2>Rivers and lakes of Uzbekistan. General data.</h2>

<p>Water resources in Uzbekistan play an important, irreplaceable role. They occupy on vast flat areas. Water is of use for irrigation, and its energy for producing an electric current. Thanks to water, the Uzbek man turned the waste into blossoming oases, flooded the cities and villages with light.</p>

<p>There are about 18,000 brooks, sais (mountain rivers) and rivers in Uzbekistan. 10 thousand of them are in the Amu Darya basin, 5 thousand are in the basin of the Syr Darya. There are 525 differen in size lakes in Uzbekistan. There are 53 reservoirs with a total useful volume of water of 15 km.cub. In the basins of the upper reaches of the rivers Surkhandarya, Kashkadarya and Chirchik there are 525 glaciers with a total area of 154.2 km2.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Uzbekistan rivers\" height=\"497\" src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/uzbekista-rivers.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<p>Because of seasonal snows the rivers of Uzbekistan form their runoff. Glacial and rain feeding of mountain rivers is insignificant. Ground waters are the main feed source for all rivers. Cracked and fissured - karst ground waters are widespread in the mountains, artesian basins are on the plains.</p>

<p>Right when the natural reserves of moisture accumulated by the soil for autumn, winter and spring are already depleted in the plains, and when the cultural vegetation, especially in need of water, the rivers and glaciers carry it in the required quantity. Examples of such Uzbek rivers are Chirchik, Karadarya, Naryn and small rivers Sokh and Isfara, flowing from the northern slopes of the Turkestan range to the Ferghana Valley.</p>

<p>Uzbekistan has many artificial lakes - reservoirs which carry out only seasonal flow regulation. The reservoirs are many times larger than the natural reservoirs of Uzbekistan. The biggest are Kayrakkum, Kattarkurgan, Tuyabuguz, Chardara, and South - Surkhan.</p>

<p>In the valleys of large rivers, along the periphery of the cones of removal, there are many bogs. It is often difficult to distinguish swamps from lakes, since in dry periods of the year some Uzbekistan lakes turn into wetlands. In mountainous areas, bogs are less numerous, and their area is usually small.</p>

<p>Uzbekistan is also rich in numerous natural sources of mineral waters, which due to their chemical composition have a beneficial effect on the human body. Among the revealed over the last decade, especially valuable are hydrogen sulfide, radon, aquiferous and weakly mineralized alkaline thermal waters.</p>

<p>Many of Uzbekistan healing springs are not inferior to the mineral waters of the world\'s famous balneological resorts, and such sanatoriums as Chartak and Chimion built on the basis of their use are known far beyond overseas.</p>

<h2>Main rivers in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>Most of Uzbekistan rivers arise in the mountains. When entering the plain, some of their water is disassembled through canals for irrigation, the other part is evaporated or absorbed into the soil.</p>

<p>The Amu Darya is the most abundant and largest river of Central Asia. The Arabs called it Jay-hun, the Greeks called it the White River, the locals named it Omul. The Amu Darya is one of the most turbid rivers in the world. In one cubic meter of its water there are 3740 grams of silt.</p>

<p>The longest Uzbek river is the Syr Darya (3,019 km); and in terms of its high water level, it ranks the second place after the Amu Darya. Ancient Arabs called the Syr Darya Sayhun, Greeks - Yaksart. The Syr Darya feeds on thawed snow and glacial waters, so the most high-water period falls in June - August.</p>

<p>The Chirchik, the right tributary of the Syr Darya, is the largest and most water-rich Uzbek River. The river’s length is 397 km. The Chirchik had several more tributaries (Aktashsai, Galvasai, Parkentsai, etc.), but now they do not deliver their waters to the river, since they are fully disinfected for irrigation.</p>

<p>The Zeravshan River is considerably inferior to the Amu Darya and Syr Darya by its water innage and length, but it is no less important in Uzbekistan. On its shores cities-pearls of Central Asia - Samarkand and Bukhara sprang up.</p>

<p>Uzbek river - Surkhandarya is the main water artery of the Surkhandarya region. The length of the Surkhandarya is 196 km (including the main tributary). The catchment area in the mountainous part is 8230 km2. The South Surkhan Reservoir, near the city of Kumkurgan, was built on the river, and the Tupalang reservoir was built on the Tupalangdarya tributary.</p>

<p>The river in Uzbekistan Akhangaran is the right tributary stream of the Syr Darya. The names Angren and Kultushkan are also used. The Akhangaran originates from the merger of the Aktashshai and the Urtalyksai. The length of the river together with the Aktashsai is 236 km, and the basin area is 7710 km ².</p>

<h2>List of famous lakes in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>The lakes in Uzbekistan are small and uneven. The Sudochye Lake and the Arnasai lakes are the largest.</p>

<p>The Aydarkul lake is a part of the Aydar-Arnaisai water system. Lake Aydarkul is called the turquoise \"sea in the sands\". It is able to delight and enchant the most experienced people, who have seen on the earth much beauty and a lot of rarities of nature. Uzbek Lake Aydarkul is a kind of ecological antipode of the Aral Sea, a huge drainage basin. It attracts travelers, tired of the desert and the steppes.</p>

<p>The Sudochye lake is one of the richest in diversity avifauna of water bodies in Uzbekistan. In total, there were more than 230 species of birds, including 12 globally threatened species, as well as 3 types, endangered in Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>The Aral Sea can also be reckoned in the largest lakes of Uzbekistan. It enters the southern part of Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>As elements of the landscape, Uzbekistan water resources influence on other components of nature. Rivers and lakes in Uzbekistan change the terrain, participate in the formation of soil and growth of plants. They are important for the national economy.</p>

{{<h2>General information regarding the Akhangaran River</h2>

<p>The Akhangaran is a river in Uzbekistan, the right affluent of the Syr Darya.&nbsp;The names Angren and Kultushkan are also used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Angren River flowing through the valley, originates from the Aktashsay and Urtalyksay rivers on the southwestern slope of the Chatkal range.&nbsp;The length of the river is 256 km.&nbsp;And the area of the Akhangaran basin is 7710 km ².&nbsp;Numerous says fall into the Angren River. They are the Boksuk-say, the Tuganbash-say, the Shavaz-say, the Dukent-say, the Karabau-say, the Akcha-say, the Naugarzan-say, the Jigiristan-say, the Kairagach-say, the Besh-say, the Nishbash-say, the Gush-say and others.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"angren river\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/angren-river.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></div><br />

<p>The Akhangaran River plays an important role in the irrigation of the Akhangaran valley.&nbsp;The dale itself is situated at an altitude of 1200 meters above sea level.&nbsp;The valley of the Akhangaran River takes the beginning on the Akhangaran plateau from the Chatkal massif.</p>

<p>Here the river takes a number of right tributaries, which in their upper reaches formed narrow gorges, on the plateau have the character of flat rivers, and before flowing into the Akhangaran they overflow by beautiful waterfalls.</p>

<p>It\'s hard to believe, but a hundred million years ago, before the advent of dinosaurs, the valley was a bay of a warm sea.&nbsp;At the bottom of the bay there were deposits from shells of large mollusks.&nbsp;Limestone ridges, which today can be seen along the mountains, were formed from them.</p>

<p>The Akhangaran valley is one of the centers of development of agriculture in the region: on the right bank of the Akhangaran River, ruins of a settlement of the III-IV centuries were found. It is established that the inhabitants of this village used sickles, cream liners, stone grain handles; and for the cultivation of land - compound hoes.&nbsp;In the IV - Vll centuries on the site of this settlement a fortress and a settlement Namudlyg arose.</p>

<h2>Legend about the name “Angren”</h2>

<p>The name of the Angren River is preserved in the people legend-fairy tale. Long ago, high in the mountains, a black tower was. An evil sorcerer - the proprietor of the mountain lived&nbsp;in the tower.&nbsp;He had everything: diamonds, gold, silver.&nbsp;He had a daughter Adal - the most beautiful girl in the valley.&nbsp;Once a young shepherd Angren saw the girl and straightway fell in love with her.&nbsp; In the evenings he played the dutar and sang of his love.&nbsp;The songs were sad.&nbsp;After all, the daughter of a magician for a poor shepherd was as inaccessible as these distant stars ... \"Such songs can only be composed by the smartest, the best person,\" she thought.&nbsp;And Adal was not deceived.&nbsp;When they happened to meet, Angren and Adal liked each other.&nbsp;They began to meet secretly from Adal’s father ... Days passed.&nbsp;The shepherd folded many songs about his beloved.&nbsp;And when the time came Adal told Angren a secret of the magic treasure.&nbsp;It was a treasure of sun stone. She said to Angren: \"Wonderful stones save a lot of warmth and light. Take this mystery to people, they have outposts, they have nothing to keep warm in bad weather ...\" The girl disappeared into a gloomy tower, and the shepherd went to look for treasure in order&nbsp;to give it to ordinary people.&nbsp;Angren could not find the treasure.&nbsp;He thought and decided: \"I have to find a true friend.&nbsp;And he went around the world, turning into a stormy river, beckoning and calling people to him.&nbsp;And Adal, having lost his beloved, in a fit of desperation, rushed from the cliff.&nbsp;And where the drops of her blood fell, bright poppies grew ... Bewitched by the beauty of the Angren valley, people came here and found the treasure of the evil wizard.&nbsp;These were coal beds of coal. This is a legend, but according to the scientists\' assumption, the name Angren is the transformed name of the Akhangaran River, which in ancient Turkic means \"the valley of the iron affairs of the masters\".</p>

{{<p>Uzbekistan still remains little-known region for many Europeans. The steppes, deserts and mountains are beautiful.</p>

<p>But the most impressive parts of nature in these places are rivers. The Amu Darya is a large water artery in Central Asia.</p>

<p>The river Amu Darya is a large hard worker. It supports the lives of millions of people who cannot imagine life and work in this desolate land without of water. The whole flow is come apart for irrigation of leas and the maintenance of the life of cities and villages.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Amudarya river\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/amudarya-river.jpg\" width=\"700\" /></div>

<h2>Amu Darya River location</h2>

<p>The Amu Darya is a large river, made up of the merger of the Vakhsh and Panj rivers sources in the High Pamir. The Amu Darya streams in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, where it borders on Afghanistan and Turkmenistan. Then it again \" retraces\" in Uzbekistan. The river mouth is in Karakalpakstan.</p>

<p>The riverheads of the Amu Darya are among the powerful mountain ranges of more than 5000- 5500 m, and individual peaks reach 6000-7000 m. This mountain of the Amu Darya basin is marked out by a wide development of the eternal snows and glaciers.</p>

<p>The main Amu Darya tributaries are Surkhandarya, Kifirnigan, Sherabad, Kunduz. Further, it leaks in the wastes of the Karakum and Kyzylkum, down to the mouth there are no tributaries. For that reason, the vigour of the Amu Darya highly depends on snowmelt, glaciers and a few rain.</p>

<p>The Amu Darya River is meandering, long and stubborn, in the ancients’ judgment. On its way the river overcomes the high mountains and immense deserts.</p>

<p>The color of the Amu Darya River is dark chocolate and it is very muddy. The river carries a huge amount of suspended particles.</p>

<p>In terms of volume of silt in the water, the Amu Darya ranks one of the first places among the rivers of the globe. In one cubic meter of water it contains up to 3.5 kg of silt, four times more than in the Nile and more, somewhere in 30 times, in the Volga. This river throughout the middle and lower currents represents a series of separate channels, separated by chalk and sandy islands. In these separate branches, the river flows at different speeds and has different longitudinal gradients. On the chemical side, the water of the Amu Darya is highly mineralized, it has a lot of chlorine, almost 6 times greater than in the Nile water.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Amu Darya\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/amudarya.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></div>

<h2>Amu Darya – the whip of God</h2>

<p>The confrontation of the Amu Darya with the \"whip of God\" came from legends, in their own way, interpreted the frequent and abrupt change in the direction of the river bed.</p>

<p>From of old the river has been famous for its wayward character. Because of its whims, cities and whole civilizations were killed.</p>

<p>On the plains the river behaves like a mistress. The Amu Darya winds as it pleases. Only the Mississippi can argue with variability of character of the Amu Darya.</p>

<h2>Legend about Amu Darya</h2>

<p>With the Amu Darya a beautiful legend is associated. It says that a long time ago in one village two twin sisters lived and they were called Amuda and Darya. Since childhood, the sisters have been very attached to each other, just \" thick as thieves \", but the girls grew up, and a misfortune happened. Unfortunately both sisters fell in love with one guy and began to compete. Not the guy they chose, because his character was evil, arrogant and insincere. Having fun with the sisters, he married a rich and noble bride.</p>

<p>As the sisters knew about it, they were seized with grief and realized that they loved the unworthy man. The girls went to a field, obeyed each other, embraced and turned into a wide and deep river to be always together.</p>

<h2>Gloss of the Amu Darya name</h2>

<p>In the I - II centuries the Amu Darya was known as Oke or Oxus: so, by the ear of ancient authors, the local name of the river Okuz, originated from the Turkic word \"oguz\" - the stream.</p>

<p>In the Arab annals, this river is referred as Djeyhun. However, the most evident is the Old Iranian version, telling that from the XIV-XV centuries the name of the Amu Darya River has been affirmed. It was formed from the name of Amul city located on the river (nowadays - Turkmenbad, Turkmenistan) and the Turkic \"darya\" or \"dare\" - a large full-flowing river.</p>

<h2>Amu Darya - the river of life</h2>

<p>The nature of the Amu Darya is mainly tugai landscape, with characteristic plants: tamarisk, reed, turanga, willow, salt tree, licorice, various glassworts. The tugai forest is a product of the river alone. The river creates the soil, collects sand and clay, fertilizes with silt and washes away excess salt, and its flow brings seeds, rhizomes and young growth of trees and shrubs.</p>

<p>In barely passable areas of the Badai-tugai jackals are encountered, in a shrub thickets there are badgers, jungle cats-manul, foxes, long-eared hedgehogs, hares. From wild ungulates in tugai wild boars and Bukhara deer live. Patterned and snake-like, lizard steppe agama and Central Asian tortoise are usual for river banks.</p>

<p>The ichthyofauna of the Amu Darya has 40 species of fish. In the waters there are asp, aral barbel, catfish, bream, sabrefish, white amur, silver carp. This is also the only habitat for endemic Amu Darya shovelnoses, which are threatened species.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Amudarya river in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/amudarya-river-in-uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></div>

<h2>Fishing and some tourist attractions</h2>

<p>Fishing in the Amu Darya (Uzbekistan) is developed and loved by local inhabitants. In the turbid waters there are such types of fish as: salmon, carp, asp, barbel. The amateur fishing without restrictions lasts from May to October. In addition to barbel, in the river heads there is osman, which has related roots with trout. For tourists who want to <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">book a tours to Uzbekistan</a>, Peopletravel is ready to organize amazing trips along the riverbed. The Amu Darya attracts rafting enthusiasts. Just a few hours drive from <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a>, <a href=\"[[~514]]\" target=\"_blank\">Karshi</a> and you get to the campsite, from where the extreme expeditions start.</p>

<h2>Aral-Paygambar Island</h2>

<p>In the middle of the Amu Darya River (Uzbekistan), 20 km downstream from <a href=\"[[~598]]\" target=\"_blank\">Termez</a> the Aral-Paygambar Island lies. The space of the island mainly consists of impassable tugai thickets and swamps with sandy desert areas. In 1960, the \"Aral-Paygambar\" reserve was established here.</p>

<p>The name of the island Aral-Paygambar is translated from the Uzbek language as the Island of the Prophet. Here is the grave of the Islamic and biblical prophet Zul-Kifl. The prophet commanded his body to be laid in a vessel and buried in the place where the boat will land on the shore. The boat stopped in the midst of the Amu Darya River. The island appeared in this place miraculously.</p>

<p>The Amu Darya nature reserve is located around the mausoleum. The plant and animal life of the reserve is unusually rich. There are dozens of scarce species of animals and plants, but the main interest is represented by Bukhara deer, which are also called Khanguls. These animals are very special. This relatively small deer of sandy-gray color rarely reaches 200 kilograms of weight. Graceful horns of males are often crowned with five sprouts.</p>

<p>Twenty - thirty years ago tigers were the main and almost the only enemy of these deer. Now there is no tiger on the island.</p>

<p>On the trails of wild boars or jackals, you can often see round traces of a jungle cat, a typical inhabitant of the Aral-Paigambar. Less often, there are imprints of small paws of an exquisite fox-caracana. In 1966, after a long break, striped hyenas reappeared on the island. The Island was declared a protected area for preserving the nature of tugai forests.</p>

{{<p>The Syr Darya has a reputation for the \"Queen of Central Asia\", because it is the longest (2,992 km) and the second most abundant river of this region.&nbsp;Starting in the mountains, it passes several natural zones, flowing between hot sand dunes, snow-covered shores in the Baikonur region (Kazakhstan), and dissolves in the Aral Sea.<br />
Compared with the major water arteries of the world, the Syr Darya of Uzbekistan is not the most abundant - about 700 m3 / s.&nbsp;But thanks to spring melting of ice and snow in the mountains, the river flows heavily.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Syr Darya river\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/syr-darya-river.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></div><br />

<h2>Syr Darya river location</h2>

<p>When the Naryn and Karadarya rivers merge in the mountains the Syr Darya River rises in the eastern part of the <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Fergana Valley</a>.&nbsp;It overflows the valley, then it crosses the Farhad mountains, forming the Begovat rapids.&nbsp;Further, the river enters the <a href=\"[[~2827]]\" target=\"_blank\">Hungry Steppe</a> - a huge clay and saline desert.<br />
The <a href=\"[[~2837]]\" target=\"_blank\">Angren</a>, Chirchik and Keles rivers, which are the large tributaries of the Syr Darya are in the middle reaches of the river.&nbsp;Here in 1949 a large Syr Darya water power plant was constructed.&nbsp; It was the most powerful station in the Uzbek SSR.</p>

<p>The lower reaches of the Syr Darya skirts the <a href=\"[[~2828]]\" target=\"_blank\">Kyzylkum Desert</a>.&nbsp;Here the watercourse quirks in the sands among the thickets of black saxaul. Here the Syr Darya takes its last inflow - Arys.<br />
The lower reaches of the river are imbued with many channels and overgrown with reeds.&nbsp;It is one of the chief agricultural areas, where rice, watermelons and melons are cultivated. Even lower, the Syr Darya makes up a delta rich of small lakes and swamps.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Syr Darya river in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/syr-darya-river-in-uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></div><br />

<h2>Etymology of the Syr Darya</h2>

<p>From local Turkic dialects the first part of the word \"Syr\" can be translated as \"mysterious\", \"secret\".&nbsp;And \"Darya\" means a river.<br />
Some other scientists suppose that with the use of various Iranian and Turkic languages, \"Syr\" is explained as \"abundant\", \"good\", \"spacious\", \"supreme\" and \"main”.</p>

<p>According to annals of Greek historians the middle course of the river was called \"Tanais\", which was carried from the famous river Don-Tanais, which overflowed the lands of the Scythians.&nbsp;The presence of two Tanais, Central Asian and European, was noted by&nbsp;the Greek writer Arrian.&nbsp;By his hypothesis, the Syr Darya also was called \"Yaksart\" - an ancient local name, which probably was distributed among the local Saks tribes.<br />
Strabon wrote that the river Iaksart separates the Saks from the Sogdians. Sharafaddin Yazdi called the Seikhun River the Syr Darya and claimed that it differentiated Mogulistan and Maverannahr.</p>

<h2>Popular believes and a legend of the Syr Darya</h2>

<p>People long since settled along the riverbed of the Syr Darya. The local population knew about the volatile nature of the river and depended on it, and tried to appease the river with sacrifices.&nbsp;And now some residents of coastal settlements believe that by bringing the river a victim in the form of an animal, they can protect their homes from another Syr Darya spill.</p>

<p>On the Syr Darya shore there is a mountain ridge Shirin.&nbsp;The character of the folklore of the Turkic peoples, and especially the Uzbek had this name.&nbsp;The narrative of the love of Farhad - stonemason and the beautiful niece of the sultan Shirin is touchingly described in the works of medieval authors Nizami Gyanjavi and Alisher Navoi.&nbsp;According to the legends, Shirin was to marry a man who could lead the waters of the Syr Darya through the Hungry Steppe.&nbsp;Farhad fulfilled the dream of Shirin and built a canal with the help of which the Syr Darya rushed to the Hungry Steppe.&nbsp;However, the padishah Khosrov deceived the girl and convinced her that he fulfilled her desire, and Shirin married him.&nbsp;When the fraud was exposed, Farhad was petrified by grief, and Shirin, who shed a lot of tears, turned into a river.</p>

{{<h2>General representation of the Chirchik River</h2>

<p>The Chirchik of Uzbekistan is running in the <a href=\"[[~190]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tashkent region</a>. The Chirchik River flows from the declivities of the Talas Alatau and its south-western spurs.</p>

<p>At the upper part (about 30 km) the Chirchik flows in the ravine, the valley widens below and loses the characteristic features of the relief.&nbsp;The feeding is mostly snowy.&nbsp;Ice phenomena are from November to March.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"river chirchik\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/river-chirchik.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></div><br />

<p>The Chirchik has a deal of tributaries;&nbsp;all of them fall on the upper part of its valley, bordered by mountains.&nbsp;There are no inflows in the low part of the Chirchik valley.<br />
<br />
Two tributaries of the Chirchik are large enough: on the right - the Ugam River, on the left – the Aksakatasay.&nbsp;Only these rivers do not run out until the mouth year-round.&nbsp;The remaining tributaries are currently being disposed of for irrigation or have a drying section in the lower reaches.&nbsp;The descending ones reach the Chirchik River in high water and in high floods, and in summer and autumn they can dry up completely.</p>

<p>Ugam, Kok-Su, Pskem, Chatkal are the main rivers falling into the Chirchik River.<br />
The Chirik River flows through Tashkent.&nbsp;It is the general water source for the Tashkent Valley.&nbsp;In the upper reaches it divides into the canals of Boz-Su and Kara-Su, which further by independent rivers flow to the <a href=\"[[~2839]]\" target=\"_blank\">Syr Darya River</a>.<br />
155 kilometers - the length of the Chirchik; the area of the Chirchik river basin is 14.9 thousand km².&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Chirchik river\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/chirchik-river-in-uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<h2>Origin of the name “Chirchik”</h2>

<p>There is no official version of the name of the Chirchik River.&nbsp;Therefore, it is worthwhile to guess why it was so called.&nbsp;In the local history museum of the city of Chirchik legends about the river, its ancient names Farak, Parak, Turk clearly indicating the Arab origin, are told.<br />
<br />
About its later name, it is said that the four rivers merge into one, and<br />
therefore in translation from the Farsi “Chorchik” means \"Four rivers\" or \"Fast\".<br />
<br />
But, as is known even in the XIII century, the yoke of the Arab caliphate fell, and in the XVI century the Uzbek language became fully in use.&nbsp;And it was then that the river was named “Chirchik”.<br />
<br />
If you address to the Uzbek language, you can find words similar in sound and meaning, such as Chor - king, royal, and Check - border, limit, lot, fate.&nbsp;And indeed in those days along the river Chirchik the border of the Tashkent Khanate passed and perhaps then it was called Chorchek - the royal border.&nbsp;Another version “Sherchek” is possible, where “Cher” means “lion”, “brave” and then the river bears the name – “fate”, “brave” or “lion”.<br />
<br />
The Chirchik River really resembles a lion with its habits and power, and for sure, our ancestors could not fail to notice this.&nbsp;And the Russian, appeared here in the XVIII century, converted it from Sherchek to Chirchik, perhaps, for euphony.<br />
The Chirchik is a river of hero, the river - toiler.&nbsp;Looking back in the distant past, you can see sites of primitive people, rock carvings, telling as its waters irrigated huge areas of land, which created auspicious conditions for the growth of a settled agricultural culture.</p>

{{<h2>Generically about the Surkhandarya River in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>The Surkhandarya river in Uzbekistan is the right affluent of the Amu Darya.<br />
The name is erected to the Tajik \"red river\" (surkh - red, darya - river).<br />
The Surkhandarya is formed thanks to merging of two rivers - Tupalangdarya and Karatagdarya, flowing from the southern side of the Gissar Range.</p>

<p>The river’s length is 175 km.&nbsp;Two streams Sangardak and Khojapalak flow into the river Surkhandarya.&nbsp;The Surkhandarya feeds on thawed snow and glacier waters.&nbsp;Many sources that come out from under the ground allow plants to grow green in the mountains even in the hottest summer time, when the grass in the steppes completely burn out.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Surkhandarya\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/surkhandarya.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<p>The area of the Surkhandarya basin is 13 500 km ².&nbsp;The average long-term water use is 70.2 cubic meters per second.&nbsp;In the high water period - 600 m3 / sec. Hydrogen sulfide springs of the Surkhandarya basin are not inferior to the widely known waters of Matsesta.<br />
The South Surkhan Reservoir, which is used for irrigation is on the river.</p>

<h2>Sights along the Surkhandarya River</h2>

<p>55 km north-west of the district center Shurchi, in the valley of the Khojaypak River, the right feeder of the Surkhandarya River is the Khojaypak Cave.&nbsp;The cave is unusual for having in it a large spring with a flow rate of about 20 liters per second.&nbsp;The length of the cave is over 220 m and a volume is 2700 m3.The spring breaks out from the bottom of the cave, at 30 m distance from the entrance.&nbsp; Khojaypak cave is a corridor-type gallery.<br />
<br />
The entrance starts with a fairly spacious grotto. A powerful hydrogen sulfide river runs at the bottom at a yield of about one and a half meters, from 20 to 60 cm in depth.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Surkhandarya river\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/surkhandarya-river.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<p>Long-ago, the territory of the present Surkhandarya region was a part of Bactria.&nbsp;The first human stands appeared in the dales of the rivers of the Baysun Range, among the mountain forests that give abundant gatherings of wild fruits and are inhabited by different species of savage beasts.&nbsp;One of the earliest is the famous grotto Teshiktash, located in the mountain gorge Zautoloshsay, refers to the Middle Paleolithic era.</p>

{{<h2>Generally about Lake Sudochie</h2>

<p>Uzbek Lake Sudochie is located in the western part of the <a href=\"[[~2838]]\" target=\"_blank\">Amu Darya delta</a>, and is the largest inland water reservoir of the Amu Darya.&nbsp;The arms of the Amu Darya Raushan and Priemuzyak feed it.&nbsp;In the background, the Ustyurt plateau rises.<br />
Until the Amu Darya made the Sudochye Lake full, it connected to the <a href=\"[[~131]]\" target=\"_blank\">Aral Sea</a> through the channel.&nbsp;Today, the big water left about 150 km from here, and the lake became shallower and disintegrated into several smaller ones.&nbsp;And now they speak about the Sudochie system of lakes.</p>

<p>Formerly the Sudochie Lake was the largest inland water reservoir with a water mirror of 350 square kilometers and a depth of up to 3 meters.<br />
Intensive withdrawal from the Amu Darya resulted in a significant drying out of its delta, and soon the lake lost its agricultural importance. Currently, the influx has been restored, mainly due to collector-drainage water. Lake Sudochie was occasionally filled in at times, and in some periods it was even planned to transfer some of the water to the Western Aral.&nbsp;At present, Sudochie is 80-85 km from the Aral Sea<br />
<br />
The coastal zone is covered with small bushes, salt, and the soil is struck by a variety of texture and color.&nbsp;Today the shallower lake is likely to be completely ford.<br />
In the warm season, the water warms up to 25-27 ° C.&nbsp;In November-December the reservoir freezes, is opened at the end of February or beginning of April.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Sudochye lake\" src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/Sudochye-lake.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<h2>Name “Sudochie”</h2>

<p>The origin of the word Sudochie is interesting. In the Uzbek language the lake is called \"Suvdoshin\", from the words \"suv\" (water) and \"shin\" (true) \"fresh water\".<br />
You can visit this lake as part of <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">tours to Uzbekistan from&nbsp;Peopletravel Company</a>. It can be an exciting event for fans to discover the secrets of history.</p>

<h2>Plants and birds on the Sudochie Lake</h2>

<p>On the Sudochie wetland there is an ornithological reserve \"Lake Sudochie\".&nbsp;In the system of the lakes of Sudochie wetland, up to the year 2000, 218 bird species were recorded, 12 of which were included in the IUCN Red Book.&nbsp;In low-water years, the number of birds decreased from 70.5 to 2.6 thousand. Plants forming the main landscape were karabarak, glasswort and tamarisk by that time.&nbsp;Reed meadows were in a depressed state, due to a lack of moisture, an outbreak of locust development and intensive pasture of livestock.&nbsp;On the Sudochye Lake, in comparison with the Great Aral Sea, a fairly rich community of aquatic animals of Aral origin has survived: marine shell infusoria, bryozoans, sea ring clam worm, copepods, etc.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Lake Sudochye\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/lake-sudochye.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<p>If you look carefully at the Sudochie Lake, you can see that here and there migrating birds flock to the shallows. For them the Sudochie has always been a place of rest on the way of seasonal migrations.<br />
There is an interesting fact, in 2014 on the eastern edge of Lake Sudochie, a colony of flamingos numbering 7000 adult birds was found.&nbsp;Speaking of the nesting of flamingos in Uzbekistan, in the Red Book of the Uzbek SSR (1983), it is listed as a species that occurs only during the autumn and spring spans.&nbsp;But according to the research of V.P.&nbsp;Kostin in 1956 there is an indication that a small colony of flamingos settled in shallow water in remote places east of Lake&nbsp;Sudochie.</p>

{{<p>Zeravshan (or Zarafshan) is the ancient affluent of the <a href=\"[[~2838]]\" target=\"_blank\">Amu Darya </a>flowing in the lands of Central Asia.&nbsp;The whole area of the basin is 41 860 km ². The Zeravshan begins in the Zeravshan glacier in the Koksu junction, formed by the joint of the Turkestan and Zeravshan ranges. The initial section of the flow, about 300 km long, runs in a narrow and deep dale, of which the upper 200 km river is called Matcha.</p>

<p>Crossing the border of Uzbekistan, the river Zeravshan turns to the northwest, creating a unique oasis, where the fairy-tale <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">city of Samarkand</a> is located.&nbsp;Then it passes through the arid territories of Kattakurgan and <a href=\"[[~519]]\" target=\"_blank\">Navoi</a>, turns to the southwest of the country, carrying its waters through <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a> and Karakul cities.&nbsp;The Zeravshan River ends its waterway in the desert, before it comes to the ancient mouth of the Amu Darya.</p>

<p>The total extent of the river is 887 kilometers.&nbsp;In the upper stream, it receives water from numerous tributaries, and in the lower reaches it has a huge number of diversion canals that take up almost 85% of the entire water flow for household needs.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"River Zaravshan\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/river-zaravshan.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<h2>Meaning of the word “Zeravshan”</h2>

<p>The literal name of the Zeravshan in Persian is translated as \"gold bearing\".&nbsp;The ancient Greeks called it Politimet or «much honoured\".&nbsp;Most likely, this is a translation from a local dialect, for the Greeks could hardly have worshiped the Central Asian rivers.&nbsp;In this the Chinese travelers helped to examine. They called it Nami, which means \"revered\".</p>

<p>Such great cities as Samarkand and Bukhara have grown on the banks of this river.&nbsp;In addition, once there was the ancient city of Sarazm.&nbsp;Its ruins are listed in UNESCO.</p>

<h2>Legend about the Zeravshan River</h2>

<p>The gold-bearing river Zeravshan was nicknamed thanks to an ancient legend saying that in old times a great drought happened in Samarkand and the river left.&nbsp;The regent of the ancient city was saddened and went to the sage - hermit to ask for advice.&nbsp;The sage gave a hint the tsar to send the children of two Samarkand widows, three sons and three daughters to fight with the dark forces that stole water.&nbsp;The girls had to take post pigeons with them, which would bring news about the events.&nbsp;Residents of Samarkand were ordered by the sage to believe in the best and make ready for the holiday on the river bank. As soon as the last pigeon with long-expected news arrived, the holiday began and 5 thousand of horsemen with sacrificial rams entered the river bed.&nbsp;Water appeared and with noise and a roar rushed along an empty channel, leaving on the skins of rams grains of precious sand and whole nuggets.&nbsp;Soon a whole pile of gold was on the shore.&nbsp;Since then, the Zeravshan is a gold-bearing river.<br />
<br />
Legend of the legend, but the Zeravshan indeed carries its waters across the territories rich in gold bed, many of which are developed today.</p>

<h2>Zeravshan Reserve in the bottomland of the Zeravshan River</h2>

<p>In the flood plain of the middle reaches of the Zeravshan River is the Zeravshan Reserve.&nbsp;It was founded in 1975.&nbsp;The area is 23 760 hectares. Tugai forests predominate in the vegetation cover (about 30%), thickets of sea-buckthorn, reeds, shrubs,&nbsp;fragments of deserts.<br />
<br />
The Zeravshan floodplain, like many thousands of years ago, is populated by Zeravshan pheasant.&nbsp;In 1978 they were more than 2000. Even a nursery for their breeding works.</p>

<p>In addition to the pheasant, the kingfisher, the white-winged woodpecker, the small turtledove, the black crow, the rook, the forty, the Bukhara tit, the ordinary starling, the crested lark, the field sparrow permanently live here. The golden bee-eater, the hobby falcon, the scops owl, the tugai nightingale are only in the summer. In the reserve there are fox, jackal, hare-Tolai.</p>

{{<h2>General information about the Aydarkul Lake</h2>

<p>The Aydarkul is one of the most vivid sights in Uzbekistan, it is the motton blue sea in the eternal <a href=\"[[~2828]]\" target=\"_blank\">Kyzyl-Kum sands</a>.&nbsp;It is located 50 km.&nbsp;from <a href=\"[[~503]]\" target=\"_blank\">Nurata city</a> and is an artificial pool in the Aydar-Arnasay system of lakes, which includes three salt lakes: Aydarkul, Arnasay and Tuzkan.&nbsp;<br />
The length of the Aydarkul Lake exceeds 250 km., and its width is 15 km.&nbsp;Today the mirror of the giant Aydarkul Lake is 3000 squared kilometers. It lies at an altitude of 247 m. above sea level.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"lake Aydarkul\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/lake-aydarkul.jpeg\" width=\"950\" /></div><br />

<h2>History of forming the Aydarkul Lake</h2>

<p>The history of the formation of Uzbek Lake Aydarkul is very interesting. The fact is that until the middle of the last century, on the site of the lake there was a dry land that did not have access to moisture, except for the spring season.&nbsp;In the spring, Lake Tuzkan, which evaporated with the coming of the heat, was formed here.&nbsp;At the same time, the Chardara hydroelectric power station with sluices to verify the water level was built.&nbsp;Water in the hydroelectric power station came from the <a href=\"[[~2839]]\" target=\"_blank\">Syr Darya River</a>, but in 1969 the station could not withstand the abundant water flow and the floodgates were partly opened to avoid dam breakthrough.&nbsp;Therefore, the water began to flow into the Arnasay lowland, where later Lake Aydarkul was formed.&nbsp;The lake unites many small rivers (kultuks).</p>

<p>Not only narrow shallow straits, but also all small lakes connected to large water during the spring rise, or even quite insulated small tanks fed by groundwater are called the kultuks.<br />
The Aydarkul has a great variety of kultuks, and this is due to the specificities of the local terrain.&nbsp;The lake itself is a submerged salt depression, surrounded by low hills, beyond which a level steppe like a table stretches. After flooding of this hollow, the hills turned into islands and peninsulas, and depressions between them are these same kultuks.&nbsp;To tell the truth, you can not simply get to the big Aydarkul water, you have to force several kultuks. The salinity of the water rises from the outfall to the top of the kultuk. This is obviously seen in the algae, by which they are very strongly overgrown.&nbsp;If the thickets are continuous in the mouth, in the upper reaches they are sometimes absent altogether. They simply can not grow in such a salt brine.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Aydarkul lake\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/aydarkul-lake.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></div><br />

<p>An enormous lake with pure water, sandy beaches and farawayness from civilization create first-rate conditions for the development of fishing and observation of rare species of birds.<br />
On the banks of the Aydarkul miracle there are many sorts of birds which are listed in the Red Book: curly pelican, cormorant, red-breasted goose, lesser, white-eyed duck, steppe harrier, white-tailed eagle, black griffon, etc.</p>

<h2>Fishing on the Aydarkul</h2>

<p>One of the exciting adventures on the Aydarkul is fishing.&nbsp;And it is that for what numerous tourists from all over the country and world come.&nbsp;The lake is just teeming with fish and along with traditional kinds such as carp, barbel, asp, pikeperch, catfish, bream. For a worldly-wise fisherman it will not be difficult to catch a mudfish, marinka, or tupak.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Aydarkul\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/aydarkul.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></div><br />

<h2>Rest on the Aydarkul</h2>

<p>If you are beat up of the city bustle and noise, then the Aydarkul is the best place to relax.&nbsp;Silence is a distinctive feature of the lake, as it is situated far from inhabited areas.&nbsp;Today, 345 families live in the Aydarkul lake area, it is approximately 1760 people.</p>

<p>Among the tourists \"yurt camps\" along the Aydarkul are popular. They are located about 1.5 hours drive from the lake.&nbsp;For centuries, nomads have been living in such yurts.&nbsp;Rest in such yurt camp leaves an indelible impression on travelers.&nbsp;Here you will be offered an evening at the fire for traditional songs of a local akyn, a watching of the dawn and a camel ride along the sandy shore of the Aydarkul.</p>

<p>Of course, the main thing, for what hundreds of townspeople come here is the lake itself.&nbsp;Lake Aydarkul is charming, as in the midday heat, and at sunset.&nbsp;The lake is quiet and calm, gently enveloping the coolness of anyone.&nbsp;It is of an amazing blue color at depth and sometimes transparent amber near the coast.&nbsp;It is smooth, like a mirror, and yet, here you can admire the real surf.&nbsp;And somewhere far away, the horizon line connecting water with the sky extends.&nbsp;And looking at it, one think: \"Why?!\"&nbsp;Why are these scales called just a lake?</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Aydarkul in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-rivers/aydarkul-in-uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></div><br />

<p>Repose on the unique kilometres-long beaches with delightful soft sand and a restful atmosphere will leave a lot of enjoyable impressions.&nbsp;And Peopletravel Company will help in it.

{{<h2>Uzbekistan nature reserves. General information</h2>

<p>The issues of biodiversity conservation become most relevant due to their reduction and serious changes in the areas of plant growth and animal habitat.<br />
A network of protected nature territories plays a decisive role in preserving the biological multiplicity of Uzbekistan.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Uzbekistan nature reserves\" height=\"405\" src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/uzbek-natural-reserves.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></p>

<p>The key place in this network is occupied by Uzbekistan state nature reserves.&nbsp; Uzbekistan, state reserves are territories with a stringent regime of protection, they keep constant year-round observations of wildlife.&nbsp;One of the main targets of the Uzbek reserves is to protect the nature landscapes, uncommon and worth-while species of animals and plants in a natural setting for the posterior enrichment of other territories.&nbsp;The specialists working in them today are called upon to efficiently cooperate with the population, to find such methods of work that will make everyone realize the value of protected wildlife.</p>

<p>Natural parks of Uzbekistan are protected natural areas intended for conservation and use in natural, recreational, scientific and cultural purposes of natural objects and complexes of special ecological, cultural and aesthetic value.<br />
On the protected natural territories of Uzbekistan, large-scale works are conducted daily to restore and multiply special flora and fauna.&nbsp;These territories also serve as a natural base for a huge number of research activities and observations.</p>

<p>Uzbekistan has nine reserves, two national parks, five natural monuments, thirteen wildlife preserves and other natural sites, covering unique landscapes from barkhan sands to flowering oases, and from river tugais to alpine meadows.<br />
We bring to your attention the most popular places for visiting tourists.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek natural reserves\" height=\"713\" src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/uzbekistan-nature-reserves.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<h2>List of protected areas of Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>Hissar mountain-juniper reserve.&nbsp;This Uzbekistan nature reserve is on the western side of the Hissar Range. The area is typical mountainous with numerous gorges, karst caves, brooks, waterfalls and small glaciers.<br />
<br />
On the northwest of the Turkestan range there is Zaamin mountain-juniper reserve.&nbsp;The territory is a clear mountain range, slightly falling from east to west, covering the mid-mountain and high mountain ranges of the ridge.</p>

<p>Zarafshan state valley-tugai reserve is located in the flood plain of the Zeravshan River.&nbsp;The purpose of its creation is the restoration and preservation of the disappearing, beautiful Zeravshan pheasant. Also one of the species of animals listed in the Red Book is Bukhara deer.<br />
<br />
Kitab geological reserve.&nbsp;This nature reserve of Uzbekistan is on the south-western spurs of the Hissar Range.&nbsp;The reserved area differs from other environmental zones of the country, as it has unique geological formations.</p>

<p>Kyzylkum tugai-desert reserve, is located on the right bank of the Amu Darya River. Covered by the forest areas of the reserve are exclusively natural plantations.<br />
<br />
Nurata mountain-nut reserve.&nbsp;It is located on the slopes of the Nurata Mountains.&nbsp;The Uzbek nature reserve crosses ten large and small streams that do not dry out in the summer, carrying their clear and transparent waters in the direction of the Aidar solonchak.</p>

<p>Surkhan Nature Reserve is situated in Surkhandarya region.&nbsp;Strong hot winds and low dampness are due to the continental climate.<br />
<br />
Chatkal mountain forest reserve.&nbsp;The natural park of Uzbekistan is located in the <a href=\"[[~2812]]\" target=\"_blank\">Chatkal range</a> area.&nbsp;Here is a very picturesque, inaccessible territory with steep cliffs, screes, beautiful mountain peaks, rising to an altitude of more than 4600 m.</p>

<p>Badai-Tugai plain reserve lies in the lower reaches of the Amu Darya, on the territory of Beruni and Kegeliysk districts.</p>

<p>Karakul wildlife preserve. The wildlife preserve of Uzbekistan was established with the aim of securing the saxaul and shrub vegetation with an array of loose sands in the Amu-Bukhara and Amu-Karakul canals, protecting irrigation systems from falling asleep with sand, restoring the floristic and faunal complex inherent of the southern <a href=\"[[~2828]]\" target=\"_blank\">Kyzylkum</a>.&nbsp;The land of the reserve is a vast sandy plain with sharply continental dry, hot climate.</p>

<p>Natural monument Vardanzi. The natural monument of Uzbekistan is located near <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a> and is not far from Shafirkan city, in the center of a blooming oasis, amidst boundless cotton plains and vineyards. The intention of the monument is the protection of the remains of the once existing city of Vardanzi, now buried by sand, and the planting of saxaul.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ecocentre \"Jeyran\". Not far from Bukhara and Kagan town there is a farm for breeding animals that are endangered.&nbsp;The farm is called Ecocentre \"Jeyran\".&nbsp;Ecocentre \"Jeyran\", together with other nurseries for breeding gazelles, was founded in the middle of the 70\'s.</p>

<p>Uzbekistan has allied with the main international conventions on nature conservation, including the Convention on Biological Diversity, in the accomplishment of obligations on which a large role is played by protected areas.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Uzbekistan reserves\" height=\"578\" src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/uzbekistan-reserves.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></p>

{{<p>The locality of the Badai Tugai Reserve belongs to the Asian desert zone, and in the regional context - to the Aral-Caspian forest-growing district, which is part of the Turan (Turkestan) province.</p>

<p>The nature reserve «Badai Tugai» is in the Beruniy district of the Karakalpak Republic, close to the <a href=\"[[~2838]]\" target=\"_blank\">Amu Darya River</a>. It occupies the site formed by the main riverbed and the Kondarya channel.</p>

<p>The Badai Tugai Reserve was opened in 1971. Its area is 6497 hectares.</p>

<p>The Badai Tugai Natural Reserve was created with the aim of preserving riparian forests and fauna. Its territory represents a river floodplain with alluvial soils.</p>

<p>The acutely continental climate is typical here. Winter is characterized by the most severity and the lowest temperatures. The air temperature is very variable, ranging from + 44.4o to -30o.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Badai tugai reserve\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/badai-tugai-reserve.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></div><br />

<h2>Plant and animal worlds of the Badai Tugai Nature Reserve</h2>

<p>In the reserve there are many relic plants. Some are under threat of extinction. Here the tulip, the blossoming Erianthus and the smelly ferula grow. Half of the area of the reserve is occupied by forests, where there are turangic tugais, willows and various bushes.</p>

<p>The existence of water and a variety of nesting places attract abundance of birds to the Badai Tugai Reserve. Among the flying ones are the gray flycatcher, the redstart, and others. The goshawk, the East Siberian sparrow hawk, the swamp owl, the black lark, different species of thrushes; the common oak-tree come to wintering in the reserve from the northern regions. The settled birds in the reserve are common kestrel, blue dove, small turtledove, brown owl, eared owl, crested lark, Bukhara large tit, common meadowsweet and field sparrow. The Khiva pheasant represents a special value among the birds.</p>

<p>The fauna of riparian woodlands of the Amu Darya delta in recent years is represented by 27 species of mammals, which is 40% of their total diversity of mammals in Karakalpakstan. In the Badai Tugai Nature Reserve a jackal is common. It adheres to difficult areas. Among the shrub thickets a badger dwells, occasionally there are a reed cat and a fox. The insectivores are presented by a long-eared hedgehog and a piebald sand shrew. Among the ungulates in the reserve there is a wild boar and the Bukhara deer everywhere. Wild boars are only in riparian forests, where they eat rhizomes of reed and fruits of loch in autumn.</p>

<p>In the reservoirs there are the lake frog, the water snake, the arrow-snake and the patterned whip snake.</p>

<p>About 15 species of fish live in the waters of the Amu Darya.</p>

<h2>Protection of the Bukhara deer in the Badai Tugai Reserve</h2>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Badai tugai nature reserve\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/badai-tugai-nature-reserve.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<p>In 1975 in order of re-acclimatization two females and a male of the Bukhara deer were carried into the Badai Tugai Nature Reserve, Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>The significance of the Badai Tugai Reserve is great. The Bukhara deer as an animal, being in a catastrophic state and under a real threat of extinction, is included in the group of priority taxons of ungulates of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>

<p>The Bukhara deer is the smallest and lightest of deer. Riparian forests are the natural inhabitation for it. The intensive development of agriculture, cutting down tugais along river banks, grazing, hay making and extermination of the deer for meat and horns led to the swift reduction in its range and abundance at the end of the 19th century.</p>

<p>Works to restore the Bukhara deer began in the second half of the 20th century with the establishment of tugai reserves. The Badai Tugai Nature Reserve was set up and the Bukhara deer became the main guarded object. Now the Badai Tugai Reserve became the custodian of the biggest population of the Bukhara deer in Central Asia.</p>

{{<p>If you happened to find yourself in Uzbekistan or plan a journey to this wonderful and unique in its beauty country, make a tour to the Chatkal Nature Reserve, Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>Biological diversity on the planet is rapidly shrinking today. Plants die, animals and forests disappear. In many respects, the fault is the activity of a mankind. And concern about the further fate of species biodiversity in Uzbekistan, in particular, was expressed in the fact that the Chatkal Nature Reserve was established in 1947. The Chatkal Biosphere Reserve has an area of 35255 hectares.</p>

<p>The Chatkal Mountain Forest Reserve is located in the Tashkent region of Uzbekistan, in the western part of the <a href=\"[[~2812]]\" target=\"_blank\">Chatkal ridge</a>. The reserve is subdivided into two separate sites: Bashkizirsai, which occupies the southwestern slope of the range and Maidantal - the northern one. The southern boundary of the Maydantal site of the Chatkal Reserve passes along the Chatkal ridge itself, where the highest mountain is \"Karakush\" (3864 m. a.s.l.). The northern sides of the Chatkal ridge form glaciers and firn fields here.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Chatkal nature reserve\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/chatkal-nature-reserve.jpg\" width=\"935\" /></div><br />

<p>The locality of the Maydantal site is difficult to access, and you can get there on foot or riding a horse only.</p>

<p>The reserve is currently located on the territory of the Ugam-Chatkal State Natural National Park of Uzbekistan - Western and Eastern territories.</p>

<h2>Rivers of the Chatkal Mountainous Forest Reserve</h2>

<p>The major rivers of the Chatkal Reserve are Bashkizilsai and Sorkalisai with numerous small tributaries. In the reserved area there are dry channels, in which water occurs only during the thawing of snows. At this time, all the rivers operate in a cyclic regime: in the daytime and in the evening the water in them is low, more or less calm, not very cold, but at night the picture is quite different. The melted water rolls with a stormy, indomitable stream, drags the stone blocks, and itself it is icy. You cannot stand a minute.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Chatkal mountain forest reserve\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/chatkal-mountain-forest-reserve.jpg\" width=\"935\" /></div><br />

<p>Almost all the mountain rivers and sais are quite turbulent, it is difficult or impossible to wade them. And this is due not only to the proximity to large snow reserves on the northern slopes of the Chatkal range, but also due to untouched lush vegetation playing a soil and water protection role.</p>

<p>The climate in the Chatkal National Reserve is sharply continental, with essential dissimilarities in night and day temperatures in all seasons. Summer is dry (in the lower belts - hot), winter is cold (in the upper belts - severe and snowy). The usual annual temperature ranges from 9oC to 13oC. The absolute maximum of air temperature in summer is 39.5 ° C, and absolute minimums of winter temperatures are up to -24.1 ° C. Annual precipitation amounts on the average is 700-1000 mm per year. The frost-free period lasts 190-220 days. With rains it happens about 60 days, with a snowfall of more than 30.</p>

<p>The vegetation cover of the Chatkal Nature Reserve is extremely pretentious in composition. There are 57 species of plants that are characteristic of the flora of the Western Tien-Shan. They are included in the Red Book of Uzbekistan. 6 narrow-endemic plant species grow in the reserve. They are bare bucket-wheel lychnis, Pskem onion, allohruza, elongated anemone, red-bellied locoweed , obedient plant&nbsp; of Komarov.<br />
<br />
Vegetation justifies the name of the reserve. More than 57% of the Chatkal Mountain Forest Reserve is covered with woody and shrubby cenosis. Forests, as everywhere in the zone of dry subtropics, are thinned, undersized. The predominant tree species is Zarafshan archa, which occupies 24% of the area and grows in a wide strip of middle mountains. However, in most of the territory juniper trees are thin.</p>

<p>Here you can find such species of tree and shrubby forms as birch groves, poplar, maple, willow, esa, apple, cherry plum, walnut, apricot, honeysuckle, cotoneaster, hawthorn, mountain ash, real pistachio, blackcurrant, and rosehip.</p>

<p>The mammal fauna of the Chatkal Biospheres Reserve contains 65 species. Especially rare are ermine, least weasel, snow leopard, Siberian mountain goat, Mensbir marmot, relic gopher, fox, brown bear, stone marten, badger, Central Asian otter, Turkestan lynx, roe, wolf.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to see many of the animals during the daytime. Here you need a special skill, knowledge and necessary equipment.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Chatkal mountainous forest reserve\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/chatkal-mountainous-forest-reserve.jpg\" width=\"935\" /></div><br />

<h2>Sights of the Chatkal Reserve</h2>

<p>The Chatkal Biosphere Reserve is not only a monument of wildlife, it is also a monument of human history and culture. On the left bank of one of its rivers in 1965 ancient rock paintings - petroglyphs were discovered. By the name of the river they are known as Tereksai petroglyphs. Even more ancient rock carvings were found later in the valley of the river Bashkizilsai.</p>

<p>Some of these remarkable drawings are on huge cliffs, others on almost horizontal, flat slabs. Petroglyphs are notable for the dark surface of the stone. Images of animals, mainly wild mountain goats prevail. There are also drawings of deer and even such animals that have long since disappeared. These are the most ancient images. Later prehistoric artists drew domestic animals - horses, dogs, etc.</p>

<p>Monuments of human history and monuments of wildlife in many respects are similar. There is practical, immediate benefit neither from those nor from others. You cannot evaluate them in money. But this is not necessary, because they are priceless. They have an enduring significance for all mankind. A careful attitude to these monuments is part of our culture.</p>

<p>The Chatkal Mountainous Forest Reserve in Uzbekistan is included in the list of World Heritage. This reserve became the first national natural object in the country in this status. Employees of the reserve conduct a great scientific work for its protection and study.</p>

{{<h2>Gissar mountain-juniper reserve. Foundation and geographical location</h2>

<p>The Gissar State Reserve was established in 1983 with the purpose of preserving the typical parts of natural complexes, studying natural processes, and the conservation of endangered species of flora and fauna in the given territory.&nbsp;The Gissar&nbsp;National&nbsp;Reserve is in the southeast of Kashkadarya region on the territory of <a href=\"[[~509]]\" target=\"_blank\">Shakhrisabz</a>, Yakkabag and Kamashinsk areas, on the western spurs of the Gissar Range, at altitudes from 1750 to 4,421 m above sea level.&nbsp;The Gissar State Reserve borders on Tajikistan, and from the southeast on Surkhandarya region.</p>

<p>The Gissar mountain-juniper reserve is the largest in Central Asia.</p>

<p>The territory of the wildlife preserve is divided into 4 sections - Gilan, Mirakin, Tankhazdarya and Kyzylsu.&nbsp;The main ecotypes of the Gissar&nbsp;National&nbsp;Reserve are woods of various breeds, mainly juniper and shrubs, the area of which is 22,766.8 hectares.&nbsp;In turn, pastures occupy 24,258.3 hectares, rivers and lakes are 107.0 hectares, swamps are 461.0 ha, glaciers are 3155.0 ha, rocks and screes are 30238.0 ha.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Gissar reserve\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/gissar-reserve.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<p>The length of the Gissar State Reserve is 37 km from west to east, and 90 km. from north to south.<br />
The mountain peaks ranges can reach 2500 to 4421 meters above sea level.&nbsp;For example, the height of the Hazrati Sulton mountain is 4266 m. above sea level, Hodja-kirshivor is 4303 m. above sea level. And the highest mountain peak in the reserve territory is an unnamed peak in the Turtkuilik mountain system, which is 4421 m.&nbsp;above sea level.</p>

<h2>Climate in the Gissar mountain-juniper reserve</h2>

<p>The unique location of the reserve in the central part of the vast continent at a huge distance from the oceans determines the aridity and sharp continentality of the climate, which manifests itself primarily as significant sudden diurnal changes in the weather.&nbsp;The distribution of precipitations during the year is uneven.</p>

<p>The regime of humidification of the Gissar mountains sharply differs during the cold and warm season, although the streams on the reserve territory are more than 120. Acute moisture deficiency, cloudlessness of the sky and dry air during warm seasons are peculiarities of the climate of these places.</p>

<p>The Gissar mountain-juniper reserve is a unique territorial-natural complex.<br />
The juniper forests, poplars and walnut, the age of which is 1000 and more years have been preserved in the reserve.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Hissar reserve\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/hissar-reserve.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<h2>Water recourses of the Gissar&nbsp;Nation&nbsp;Reserve</h2>

<p>The unique features of the national park are considerably determined by rivers and lakes located on its territory.&nbsp;The glaciers of Severtsov and Batyrbay located on the border between Surkhandarya region and Tajikistan give rise to many brooks and water sources of the reserve.&nbsp;The largest are the Oksuv, Tankhaz and Kyzyl-Darya rivers.&nbsp;Uniting in the territory of Shahrisabz district these three rivers form the Kashkadarya River. Rivers, feeding on the waters of snows, glaciers, underground and rainwater form many large and wee waterfalls.</p>

<p>The Tankhaz Darya River is one of the main rivers running through the National Park in Gissar.&nbsp;Its length is 104 km, the catchment area is 459 sq. km.&nbsp;It appears due to the confluence of 27 large and small rivers and springs<br />
In the area of the Gissar&nbsp;Nation&nbsp;Reserve there are 10 different in sizes lakes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the multi-tiered nature of the Gissar&nbsp;National&nbsp;Reserve territory, in each sai, unique small and large waterfalls form. They create a unique beauty of alpine meadows in the bosom of bare rocks, massive stone walls and juniper plantations.&nbsp;One of them is the Suvtushar waterfall located in the stream of the Suvtushar on the Mirakin reserve site.&nbsp;Because of the snowy whiteness, the Suvtushar River is popularly called \"Suttushar\", which means \"Dairy Waterfall\".&nbsp;Its spilling appearance reminds a beauty with long, flowing hair flying in the wind in a stone-arch canyon, which height is 84 meters.</p>

<p>The Ok Kamar waterfall is located in the Tanhkhoz Darya area at an altitude of 3200 meters, on the top of the Sarituz plateau, and represents a huge waterfall that appears only in the spring months due to the melting of snow and heavy rains.&nbsp;The height of the waterfall is 1000 meters. The sinuous, very rapid flow of water resembles the movement of a snake on a narrowly dissected stony precipice, which enriches the nature of the sai Sarituz.&nbsp;The water stream reminds the creeping snake, which spurts forward the representatives of endemic vegetation with water spray.</p>

<p>Another significant element of the natural wealth of the reserve is the waterfall \"Khukizburun\" (which means the nostril of the bull.) The waterfall is located on the territory of Kyzylsu district. On a sunny day, a rainbow forms from the spray of water.</p>

<h2>Animal world of the Gissar mountain-juniper Reserve</h2>

<p>The unique animal and plant world, natural monuments of the Gissar State Reserve amaze the imagination of every person who has visited these places.<br />
The fauna of the reserve is diverse, the faunistic composition of vertebrates, according to preliminary data, has 268 species, of which 2 species of fish are common black fish (marinka) and Amudarya trout, 19 species of amphibians and reptiles, 215 bird species, 32 mammal species.</p>

<p>There are 4 species of mammals - Snow leopard, Red marmot, Forest dormouse, Great horseshoe, and Black vulture are listed in the Red Book of the IUCN. Here you can meet 215 species of birds.</p>

{{<p>Protection of nature and rational use of natural resources in Uzbekistan are the priority tasks. Man and nature co-exist in a special relationship. These relationships cannot be violated, as this will lead to an ecological catastrophe.</p>

<p>One of the significant objects, which conducts work on improving the ecological environment and preserving biodiversity in Uzbekistan, is \"Kugitang\"the Surkhan State Reserve.</p>

<p>The Surkhan State Nature Reserve was established in 1986 as a result of the unification of the Kugitang State Reserve and the Aral-Paigambar Nature Reserve.</p>

<p>The Surkhan Natural Reserve lies in the southwestern spurs of the Hissar range at an altitude of 150 to 3150 m. above sea level. The upper western border runs along the crest of the Kugitang Range, coinciding with the border of Turkmenistan. The western Kugitang is relatively shallow, mainly is located on the territory of Turkmenistan, eastern within the boundaries of Uzbekistan and is characterized by rock formations. The Surkhan Reserve occupies 24,583 hectares, of which 9284 hectares are covered with forest.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Surkhan nature reserve\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/surkhan-nature-reserve.jpg\" width=\"780\" /></div><br />

<h2>Water sources of the Surkhan State Reserve</h2>

<p>The area of the Surkhan Mountain Forest Reserve has a large number of constantly and temporarily operating water sources, feeding a well-developed hydrographic network consisting of numerous small streams. The largest of them is the Lailakan sai (spring). Another fairly large sai is Kizilalma. Their waters are sorted out practically from the first villages along the eastern borders of the Surkhan Reserve.</p>

<p>Some of the sais function all year round, others - depending on the winter-spring conditions of precipitation and accumulation of precipitation.</p>

<p>The general direction of the flow is from the northwest to the southeast. Nutrition in the summertime is a spring. The width of the channels is 2-5 m. The slope is large. Flood is alone - spring, arising from heavy rains and intense melting snow. The sais are very shallow in summer.</p>

<h2>Animal world of the Surkhan Reserve</h2>

<p>The reserve is inhabited by 200 species of birds, including several species of stork, golden eagle, black vulture, white-headed sip.</p>

<p>Within the Surkhan National Reserve there is still a striped hyena and the front Asian leopard, both of which are extremely rare and are on the verge of extinction in Uzbekistan. Nevertheless, the leopard has been observed several times over the past few years, and the hyena tracks were noted by the wildlife preserve of the reserve. Also the markhor and the Bukhara urial are met in the reserve.</p>

<p>In addition to these species, the Surkhan Reserve also hosts a few rare species that need protection and restoration. Here you can find a large bat - the white-shaven long-eared bat, a naturally rare and therefore a vulnerable species. Also here the Turkestan lynx lives, a vulnerable species that is declining in numbers. In the foothill plain there is a gazelle, whose number also has fallen dramatically in recent decades. From the usual species one should name a fox, a jackal, a badger, a hare, a big eared hedgehog and a wild boar.</p>

<h2>Climate in the Surkhan National Reserve, Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>The zone of ​​the reserve is characterized by sharp temperature contrasts, unstable quantity and deficit of atmospheric precipitation, low humidity of air and strong winds (\"Afghans\") .The air temperature in winter is mostly positive and is, within various heights - from + 2 ° up to +3.5 ° C. The absolute maximum of air during the summer varies from + 32 ° to 52 ° C. Precipitation falls during the autumn-winter-spring periods. The amount of precipitation varies between 405 and 410 mm. The snow cover appears in December and lasts until February. The duration of the frost-free period is 284-289 days.</p>

In the sediments of the cave, medium-paleolithic tools related to the Musty culture, a large number of bones of the mountain goats were found. Apparently, the inhabitants of the grotto obtained their livelihood mainly by hunting for mountain goats. Around the skeleton the horns of these animals, located in pairs were found. It is not excluded that they were laid intentionally.</p>

<p>The Aral-Paygambar Island was a place of pilgrimage on the territory of the Surkhan National Reserve, since one of the Muslim saints was buried there.</p>

<h2>Zaamin mountain-juniper reserve. Location and territory.</h2>

<p>The Zaamin Mountainous Forest (Juniper) Reserve is located on the northern slopes of the Turkestan range on the territory of Zaamin and Bakhmal districts of the Djizak region of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Currently it occupies an area of 26,840 hectares.</p>

<p>The territory is a clear mountain range, slightly falling from east to west, covering the mid-mountain and high mountain ranges of the ridge at an altitude of 1760 to 3500 m. above sea level. The southern part of the Zaamin&nbsp;National&nbsp;Reserve is the steep slopes of the Turkestan ridge, cut by deep narrow gorges. The northern part has a more flat terrain with terraces covered with a thick stratum of marls and loess-like loam. The soils of the reserve are represented by dark gray, brown, meadow and floodplain-alluvial soils.</p>

<p>On the territory of the Zaamin&nbsp;mountain archa&nbsp;reserve two small rivers are formed. They are Guralashsai and Kulsai, forming the river Zaamin. Of the numerous tributaries of these sais, the largest are Julsai and Tuyuksai. The length of the channel Guralashsay in the territory of the reserve is 24.5 km; Kulsay is 15.4 km.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Zaamin mountain archa reserve\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/zaamin-mountain-archa-reserve.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></div><br />

<h2>History of the Zaamin mountain-juniper reserve</h2>

<p>It is known that in the 60s of the XIX century the territory that later became the Zaamin State Nature Reserve was explored by the Russian naturalist A.P. Fedchenko. In 1925-26, a detailed forest management of the territories was carried out, which served as the basis for the creation of the Guralash reserve (an area is about 8500 hectares). The Guralash reserve existed from 1926 to 1929 and from 1934 to 1951.</p>

<p>Intensive grazing, unregulated logging (primarily juniper forests) and poaching were a serious threat to the preservation of subalpine landscapes, which in 1959 resulted in the decision to establish the Zaamin State Reserve. The reserve was recreated in 1960 on the site of the Guralash nature reserve.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"zaamin nature reserve\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/zaamin-nature-reserve.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></div><br />

<h2>Climate&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Zaamin&nbsp;mountain archa&nbsp;state reserve</h2>

<p>The climate of the Zaamin Reserve is sharply continental, the average annual rainfall, according to long-term data, is 405 mm. Most precipitation is in October, January and April. The highest temperature is in July and August, when the absolute maximum is + 33o, in December and January it drops to -34o. For all mountains sharp fluctuations in day and night temperatures and the return of cold weather after spring warming are characterized. Such severe climatic conditions allow only drought-resistant and frost-hardy trees and shrubs to grow here.</p>

<h2>Zaamin mountain-juniper reserve flora and fauna</h2>

<p>The wildlife of the Zaamin State Mountain-wood Nature&nbsp;Reserve, which belongs to the eastern Bukhara zoogeographic site, is very diverse. Here are presented all species that are typical for the mountain juniper forests of the reserves in general. A rich natural forage reserve with various grounds, places of shelter and nesting, ensures the existence of the whole complex of biodiversity.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Zaamin reserve\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/zaamin-reserve.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></div><br />

<p>From mammals there is a wolf, a wild boar, a hare-Tolai, an eastern snapper. High in the mountains in the juniper zone you can meet a bear and cubs, they are not rare in the State Reserve&nbsp;\"Zaamin\"; and in the wilderness you can hear rustling from afar tracking the lynx. Early in the morning you can see a nice little night animal - least weasel.</p>

<p>Mountain goats, the inhabitants of high mountains, rocks and talus, are also common in the reserve. They willingly visit fir and floodplain forests. Here in the highlands there were traces of a snow leopard. On stony outcrops there is the Turkestan agama, on sandy and clay slopes there are whip snakes, copperhead snakes, patterned snakes, deserted lidless skinks, grass snakes and etc.</p>

<p>On the territory of the Zaamin State&nbsp;nature reserve three types of juniper grow: Zerafshan, half-spherical and Turkestan. Half-spherical juniper forms mixed plantations in the upper part of the slopes with Turkestan one, and in the lower part with Zerafshan juniper. The undergrowth is represented by bushes: the hawthorn of Turkestan, the wild rose of Fedchenko, the honeysuckle of Korolkov, the barberry oblong, the many-flowered cotoneaster; occasionally among the rocks there is the Tien Shan rowan.</p>

<p>In spring, the low-mountain zone is indescribably beautiful. Tulips, poppies, various kinds of onions and magnificent eremurus are blooming.</p>

<p>On the northern slopes of the subalpine zone, mainly elfin wood formations of juniper grow. From medicinal plants there are more than 20 species.</p>

<p>One of the attractions of the Zaamin&nbsp;Mountain Forest&nbsp;Reserve in the meadow in Kyzyl-ataksai are the huge, high red stones of various bizarre shapes reminiscent of sphinxes. The local population calls this place \"kyrkkiz\", which means \"forty maidens\". The figures consist of conglomerates and sandstones. In some places they are polished, sometimes they have large and small cracks in which different shrubs grow.</p>

{{<h2>Uzbekistan Zarafshan State Nature Reserve. A walk along the tugai forest.</h2>

<p>Irrigating the arid lands, the waters of the Zarafshan River made it possible the oasis to be appeared. In the late 70-s of the XX century in the <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a> region the Zeravshan State Nature&nbsp;Reserve was founded. It stretched for 46 kilometers along the right bank of the river from Chapan-Ata heights. Currently, the Zeravshan&nbsp;State Reserve occupies the Bulungur and Jambay regions. From the south the reserve borders on Tajikistan. 2,518 hectares is the reserve’s area.</p>

<p>Today, ecological <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">excursions in Uzbekistan</a>, the Samarkand region are very interesting for tourists, especially trips to the Zarafshan Reserve. In this natural complex, flooded tugai forests and shrub thickets disappearing due to regulation of river flow, which retain some features of the flora of the Tertiary period, are presented. You can find sea-buckthorn, oleaster, willow, tamarisk, walnut and grapes in the Zeravshan&nbsp;National&nbsp;Reserve. Part of the vegetation has remained since the times when fruit gardens were planted in the area of the present reserve.</p>

<p>Early the Zarafshan valley was a tugai massif a few kilometers wide with impassable thickets, peculiar flora and fauna. Anthropogenic human impact led to a change in natural complexes. The forest massifs were scraped, the liberated lands were plowed up under crops of cultivated plants - cultural landscapes were created. All these changes adversely affected both the plant and animal world. Many left their former places and found still preserved lands for themselves, or disappeared forever.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Zarafshan State nature reserve\"  src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/zarafshan-state-nature-reserve.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<p>One of the motives of creating the Uzbekistan Zarafshan State Nature Reserve was to protect the Zerafshan pheasant, which is a local subspecies of the pheasant. These birds had been living in the floodplain of Zarafshan for thousands of years, but by the end of the 20th century their numbers had decreased considerably.</p>

<p>The whole territory of the Zarafshan&nbsp;State valley-tugai reserve is a plain tilted toward the river bed and along its course. Plainness of the territory is disturbed by the channels of old and existing tributaries, by river valleys, canals and dams.</p>

<p>The mesorelief of the lower terrace and the channel of the Zarafshan are characterized by a strong dissection created by the wandering channels of the river, the spills of which produce a leveling of the terrain of a large part of the Zarafshan Reserve.</p>

<h2>Fauna of the Zarafshan&nbsp;Nature&nbsp;Reserve</h2>

<p>In addition to the artificially cultivated pheasant, the local fauna includes several dozens of mammal species, among them the Bukhara deer, eared hedgehog, Bukhara tit, black-necked penduline tit, southern nightingale, gallinule, white-tailed lapwing, fiddler, porcupine, mole lemming, yellow suslik, Bukhara vole, hare-tolai, muskrat, jackal, fox-karaganka, corsac fox, jungle cat.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"bukhara deer in Zeravshan State reserve\" src=\"images/uzbekistan-nature-reserves/bukhara-deer-Zeravshan-state-reserve.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<p>Hawk, Zarafshan pheasant, marsh harrier, eagle owl, Bukhara deer, curly pelican which inhabit in the reserve are listed in the Red Book.</p>

<p>Magpie in the Zarafshan&nbsp;valley-tugai reserve is harmful to pheasants, but at the same time is their guard. When a fox or jackal approaches the pheasants, it makes such a noise that the predator runs away, and the victim flies into the shelter.</p>

<p>Since 1995 in the Zarafshan State Reserve the work on the Bukhara deer has been conducted. In 1996, 6 individuals of the deer were moved to the Zarafshan&nbsp;Nature&nbsp;Reserve from the Badai-tugai Reserve. Currently, 27 animals inhabit the reserve.</p>

<h2>Climate of the Uzbekistan Zarafshan State Nature Reserve</h2>

<p>The climate of this region is typical for continental subtropics and is distinguished by large amplitudes. The amplitude is very high both during the year and the day.</p>

<p>The coldest month is January (-27), and the hottest is July (+ 41). In summer there is a lack of rain and the greatest aridity.</p>

<p>Precipitation in the area of ​​the Zarafshan Reserve is quite a small amount: from 100 to 400 mm., and falls on the autumn-winter period. Precipitation falls in the form of rain and snow - from early December to the first ten days of March. The number of days with snow cover does not exceed 30 days.</p>

<p>The territory of the Zarafshan River basin is notable for a long duration of the sunshine, which is 2877 hours per year. The number of clear days is 150 - 160 days.</p>

<p>The wind regime of the territory in the Zarafshan Reserve&nbsp;of Uzbekistan is formed under the influence of synoptic positions, which are typical for plains and foothills.<br />

{{<p>In the East the sages said: \"Only knowing one’s roots, a person can know himself.\" This truth applies fully to the musical culture, a significant part of which are ancient instruments. So, playing drums our ancestors accompanied their dances and songs, because the rhythm was always the main component of Uzbek music. In miniatures of the beginning of the XVII century one can find an image of the national drum of nagora, without which no holiday in Uzbekistan is imaginable to this day. This unique instrument is made of burnt clay in the form of a pot, on the upper part of which a membrane of animal skin is stretched.</p>

<h2>History of Uzbek musical instruments</h2>

<p>The world of instrumental culture of Uzbekistan is extremely rich and diverse. The first data regarding musical instruments belongs to ancient times. Evidence of this is given by archaeological excavations in the territory of Uzbekistan. The first sample of a musical instrument was a longitudinal pipe-nay, found on the territory of Uzbekistan. It dates back to the 3.5 millennium.</p>

<p>Archaeological finds of wall paintings and terracotta figurines in the excavations of the ancient <a href=\"[[~595]]\" target=\"_blank\">settlement Afrasiab</a> near Samarkand, in ancient <a href=\"[[~2207]]\" target=\"_blank\">Khorezm</a> and Surkhandarya testify to the spread of such instruments as the lute, the double flute-avlos, the cithara during the Hellenistic period in Sogdiana and Bactria. And on the famous frieze of the 1st-2nd century from Ayrtam, twenty kilometers from <a href=\"[[~598]]\" target=\"_blank\">Termez</a>, an unknown artist who lived at the court of the grandee of the Kushan Tsar, depicted musicians playing the harp, flute, four-stringed lute, cymbals and a double-sided drum resembling the Uzbek national drum rez-nagora.</p>

<p>The study of Uzbek folk instruments has been conducted since ancient times. In numerous treatises-works of scholars of Central Asia of the IX-XVII centuries, one can find a description of musical instruments, the names of outstanding musicians, the names of music works known in the past. Indirect evidence of the antiquity and wealth of the Uzbek instrumentation is the image of musicians with musical instruments on wall paintings of ancient buildings found during archeological excavations, as well as terracotta statuettes of musicians.<br />
<br />
The collection and study of traditional Uzbek music has started quite widely from the last third of the 19th century. It is associated with the names of military bandmasters, who, in addition to their main work in orchestras, turn to ethnographic activities. They are, first of all, A. Eichhorn and F. Leisek. In particular, Eichhorn compiled a catalog that included thirty-six Uzbek folk instruments of various groups.<br />
<br />
A notable trace in the collection and study of Uzbek musical instruments was left by an outstanding music and public figure, composer, ethnographer and teacher Viktor Uspensky. It was on his initiative and with the lively participation that the musical ethnographic section was opened in Tashkent in 1919. One of the first results of the section\'s work is the collection of a large collection of Uzbek folk instruments and a careful study of their performing abilities.</p>

<h2>Uzbek musical instruments</h2>

<p>A wealth of Uzbek musical instruments is rich: stringed instruments, wind instruments and drums.</p>

<p>Uzbek national musical instruments in their present form have been existing for several centuries.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek musical instruments\" height=\"528\" src=\"images/Uzbek musical instruments/uzbek-musical-instruments .jpg\" width=\"940\" /></p>

<h2>Uzbek percussion musical instruments</h2>

<p>Evidently, the most favorite Uzbek percussion instrument is doira. This instrument itself gives much fun and a lot of positive emotions. On doira people play in all areas of the republic. Doira is a wooden hoop, on which the skin is stretched. Metal rings, which give a melodic sound when doira is shaked, are attached to the inner side of the instrument.</p>

<h2>Uzbek&nbsp;wind musical instruments</h2>

<p>Along with the doira, one of the most popular musical instruments of Uzbekistan is karnay. This is a long (4.5-5 meters) pipe, which is wide on the base. In the narrow upper part a wooden tube is fixed. Inside the tube itself is another thin metal tube. Musicians press a small plate to their lips and blow into it.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that karnay is one of the oldest Uzbek musical instruments, but few remember that in the medieval worlds karnay was a military signaling tool. In one miniature of the year 1430, a battle is described. There are drummers and musicians trumpeting into long karnays in the same ranks with soldiers.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Music instruments of Uzbekistan\" height=\"624\" src=\"images/Uzbek musical instruments/music-instruments-of-uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></p>

<p>Surnay is a wind instrument of a smaller size than the karnay. The carcass of the surnay with a wide socket is skillfully carved from a single piece of apricot or mulberry tree, and its metal pin is made of silver. Its sound resembles the clarinet, but because of the extra holes it reproduces unique sounds.</p>

<p>Uzbek nay is one of the most widespread musical instruments. It is used both as a solo and ensemble, orchestral instrument. In its form it is a transversal flute with 6 playing holes. It is plaid like a regular flute. Nay instrument is made from bamboo, tin and brass.</p>

<p>Nay musical instrument makes a pleasant sound, which is compared with a whisper of a mountain brook.</p>

<h2>Uzbek stringed instruments</h2>

<p>Uzbek rubab is a wooden convex case with a leather deck, metal or silk strings. The sizes of the rubab can be very different, but the optimal size is 80-100 cm. Musicians play the rubab with a bow, and while playing they hold the instrument on their knees.</p>

<p>Uzbek musical instrument dutar appeared around the 15th century. At the beginning, as it was the shepherds’ instrument, strings for the dutar were made from the guts of animals. Later strings of twisted silk were made. Now nylon or silk strings are also used.</p>

<p>Sato is an oriental ancient string-bow musical instrument with a pear-shaped body. The natural materials for sato instrument are mulberry, pear and walnut.</p>

<p>Many scholars consider Central Asia to be the birthplace of bowed stringed instruments, among which are such widespread among the Asian peoples as sato and kobuz. But the oldest bow instrument that appeared on the Uzbek land was a gidjak. The round case of it, tightened with a leather membrane, was traditionally made from coconut. The sound of a gidjak resembles a violin. It is played with the aid of a special bow-kamon.</p>

<p>The sounds of old Uzbek musical instruments give rise to the exciting mysterious music of the East.</p>

<p>In Uzbekistan the production of national musical instruments is a very complex and delicate branch of contemporary art woodworking.</p>

<p>The largest cities of Uzbekistan - Bukhara, Khiva, Samarkand have long been famous for masters of making musical instruments. The names of masters who worked in the XIX - XX centuries went down in the history of national music. Instruments worked by their hands, have long found their place in museum exhibitions and private collections. Their traditions are continued by modern masters - B. Alimov, Mirzaev brothers. The unique instruments made by famous masters can be recognized not only by the exceptional timbre of the sound, but also by the exquisite form of the case, the love decoration with fine ornamental carvings on the precious wood, inlay from bone and nacre.</p>

<p>Along with traditional instrumental Uzbek music, in the late 30s of the last century a fundamentally new performing culture which had a European orientation with characteristic style, genre and performance features was formed.</p>

<p>To date, there is an intensive rise in Uzbekistan traditional instrumental music, which continues to reflect its way of Uzbek life. The traditions of ensemble performance have received the great development in Uzbekistan. Folk orchestras and ensembles, both traditional and a new type, many-voiced, exist now everywhere.</p>

{{<p>If you are among those who are looking for new sensations or are interested in the traditions of the countries of the world, <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbekistan tour packages</a> will do for you. The culture of Uzbekistan is extremely diverse. For example, Uzbek music and traditional musical instruments are worth listening? Here is a brief overview of one of the oldest musical instrument - nay.</p>

<p>Nay belongs to a subgroup of Uzbek folk instruments among wind wooden instruments. Nay also refers to the transverse type of flute instruments.</p>

<p>Uzbek nay is an instrument, which is in shape and sound reminiscent of a flute. The material for it is usually a bamboo tree, as well as tin and brass.</p>

<p>According to the form, nay is a cylindrical tube usually 20-30 mm in diameter and 450-520 mm in length. On the upper part of nay there are six finger holes, through which seven sounds of the diatonic scale are elicited.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\"  src=\"images/Uzbek musical instruments/nay-uzbek-instrument.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></div>

<p>By varying the blowing force and closing the holes completely or halfway, Uzbek nay musicians get a chromatic scale and expand the instrument range to two and a half octaves. The sound of nay is strong and whistling, but not sharp. Technically the instrument is very mobile.<br />
<br />
When playing Uzbek melodies of nay, various types of melism are widely used, as well as different strokes (legato, staccato, portamento). Lingering melodies with slowly intonated sounds, enriched by a thin change of dynamic shades are more characteristic for nay.</p>

<p>Nay is one of the most widely used musical instruments in Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>The evidence of the ancient prevalence of flute instruments on the territory of Uzbekistan is provided by historical data, including archaeologists’ finds in the form of figurines of musicians-flutists. The earliest descriptions of nay, made by Farabi in his \"Great Book of Music\", show that in the IX-X centuries nay corresponded to modern instruments.</p>

<p>Uzbek nay is solo, ensemble and orchestral instrument. We can perform technically-mobile plays with the help of nay.</p>

<p>By the type of material there are agach-nay (wooden), garau-nay (bamboo), mis-nau (tin) and bringji-nay (brass). Agach-nay and garau-nay have an additional hole sealed with paper (located near the blowing hole), which gives the sound a special, \"membrane\" timbre.&nbsp;</p>

{{<p>Every inhabitant of Uzbekistan easily recognizes the sounds of karnay. This wind musical instrument is very popular among the people.</p>

<p>Previously, karnay was also used as a tool for convening warriors, as well as in order to alert the public that an enemy or a nuisance is approaching. The sound of karnay musical instrument was heard all over the village and people were ready for this or that action due to the loudness of the national wind instrument.</p>

<p>In the past, Uzbek karnay was also used in Central Asia as a military (signal) instrument for communication at great distances, as well as during ceremonial departures of khans and military leaders. It was along with surnay and nagora in ensembles of vagrant musicians (the sounds of karnay announced the beginning of mass festivities, performances of puppeteers, rope walkers).</p>

<p>In one of the miniatures of 1430, the Firdausi manuscript \"Shahnama\" depicts a battle, during which, in the same ranks with soldiers, there are drummers and musicians trumpeting into long karnays.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\"  src=\"images/Uzbek musical instruments/Uzbekistan-karnay.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<p>Uzbek karnay is a brass pipe up to 3 meters, the base of which is expanded. In simple terms, it is something in the form of a bell on a long leg. There are two types of pipe karnay - straight and cranked. Its first type is especially widespread. Usually, Uzbek karnay consists of three parts that join each other. Karnay has a mouthpiece, to the hole of which a 97 mm long tube is soldered inside the instrument. Its diameter gradually widens from 5 to 36 mm. The diameter of the mouthpiece is 37 mm, and the socket is 232 mm.</p>

<p>Uzbekistan karnay musician extracts sounds from the instrument, pressing a small plate - \"sadat\", and then he blows into it. Usually musicians play karnay in the standing position. By register and timbre Uzbek karnay is close to trombone.</p>

<p>Uzbek karnay is one of the most ancient tools that have come down to us without much change.</p>

<p>The instrument has a powerful and strong sound. Modern Uzbek musicians traditionally use karnay at weddings. These deep solemn sounds today symbolize the holiday. They can be heard not only from the neighboring street, they can be heard even from another quarter of the city. At the festival, melodies decorated with karnays, loudly and publicly declare that in this house the festival is celebrated.</p>

<p>In Uzbekistan karnays sound at weddings, special celebrations in honour of the birth of a child.</p>

<p>There is also the belief that if a boy or a man hears the sounds of karnay, then soon his wedding will take place.</p>

{{<p>The most favorite percussion instrument among the Uzbeks is doira. Doira is translated a “circle”. By type this musical instrument is like a tambourine. The instrument of doira is distributed in Central Asia, mainly in Uzbekistan. Uzbek doira consists of a round rib (rim) and a tightly stretched from one side of membrane with a diameter of 360-450 mm. The metal rings are fastened to the rib, the number of which now amounts to 60. Previously, the rib was made from fruit plants - dry grapevine, walnut or beech tree. Now it is made mainly of acacia. The membrane was formerly made from the skin of catfish, goat skin, sometimes the stomach of an animal, now the membrane is made of thick calfskin. Before playing doira it is heated in the sun, by a fire or lamp to increase the tension of the membrane. This contributes to the clarity and sonority of the sound. Metal hoops on the rib contribute to an increase in thermal conductivity when heated. The membrane is so strong that it is able to withstand jumps of a person and knife blow.</p>

<p>Initially, the Uzbek doira was a purely feminine instrument. The women were sitting and playing on doira, as well as Iranian women gathered and played on dafa. In the mountains of the <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Ferghana Valley</a>, one can see a portrayal of a woman, dated 2000 BC. The woman plays doira accompanied by other women-dancers. Also a statue found by archaeologists dating to 2000 B.C. depicts a woman playing a tambourine, which is similar to doira.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Doira Uzbek\"  src=\"images/Uzbek musical instruments/doira-uzbek.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<p>Now the skill of playing doira has reached an unprecedented level. In the world such a master of doira as Abos Kasimov from Uzbekistan is well known. <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">Make a travel to Uzbekistan</a> and enjoy playing of Uzbek doira.</p>

<p>The sound is extracted by striking of four fingers of both hands (thumbs serve to support the instrument) and palms along the membrane. A blow in the middle of the membrane gives a low and dull sound, a blow near the rib gives a high and ringing sound. To the main sound the ringing of metal pendants joins. The difference in the sound is achieved due to different techniques of the play: finger and palm strokes of different strength, flicks of little fingers (nouhun), gliding of fingers along the membrane, shaking of the instrument, etc. The range of dynamic shades is from a gentle piano to a powerful forte. The technique of playing doira, developed for centuries, has reached high virtuosity. Uzbek doira is played (by lovers and professionals) solo, accompanying singing and dancing, as well as in ensembles. The doyra\'s repertoire consists of various rhythmic figures - usuls. In the hands of a virtuoso performing usul, doira can produce gentle sounds resembling a rustle of the wind, or a loud drumbeat, like a spring thunder.</p>

<p>Uzbek Doira is also used in the performance of makoms, mugams. In modern times, doira is often a part of folk, and sometimes symphonic orchestras.</p>

<p>The instrument doira is also known as dap and childirma.</p>

{{<p>The origin of Central Asian musical instruments with its roots goes back to antiquity. Pictures of instruments on stone reliefs and small plastic, objects of art, wall paintings indicate that the main centers of music culture were Sogd and Bactria. Mediaeval miniature and classical poetry of the East also provide extensive information about the basic types of instruments that existed at that time, and still exist in Central Asia, including Uzbekistan. While you’re <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">traveling around Uzbekistan</a>, you will have a unique opportunity to listen and enjoy the wonderful play on dutar.</p>

<h2>History of dutar</h2>

<p>An ancient Persian instrument from the family of tunburs, widely distributed among Chinese Uighurs, in Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Uzbekistan - is dutar or dutor.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Dutar Uzbek musical instrument\"  src=\"images/Uzbek musical instruments/dutar-Uzbek-musical-instrument.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>

<p>The first evidence of the instrument appeared in the 15th century, among which the statuette \"itinerant musicians Bakhshi\" and the manuscript Toprak-Kala were. They were found by the archeologists in the excavations of the ancient Persian city Merv (Mary). The manuscript contains the image of a girl playing the dutar. Dutar formed from the Horosan variety of the ancient tanbur. Dutor was an integral part of the musical culture and creativity of the folk singers Bakhshi, the keepers of the musical and poetic tradition, classical works and ancient instruments.</p>

<h2>Uzbek dutar: general description</h2>

<p>Dutar just like in Uzbekistan is a string musical instrument. The word comes from two Iranian words: du - two, tar - string. Usually the length of dutar is 1 or 2 meters. It is shaped like a pear and has a strongly elongated neck with a fingerboard. The instrument appeared around the 15th century among the herders. Therefore, the first strings for dutar were made from the guts of animals. Later the strings were made from twisted silk. Now masters use silk or nylon. The case is made of mulberry, and is encrusted with bone.</p>

<p>When Uzbek dutar is ready, it is left to dry in the hot Central Asian sun during the summer, that, according to the masters’ opinion, gives the instrument its unique sound.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek dutar\"  src=\"images/Uzbek musical instruments/Uzbek-dutar.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<h2>Legends</h2>

<p>There are many legends about the competition of great masters among themselves, one of which tells of a duel in which one of the participants cut the string to the opponent, and during the performance it broke off. But the master continued to play with only one hand and managed to win in a duel, thereby releasing his brother from captivity. Dutar takes its place of honor in the Uzbek tradition of makom and shashmakom. It is believed that the very sound of dutar expels evil spirits. Women equally with men played dutar. There are many images instantiating the fact in the history of Uzbekistan.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek dutar musical instrument\"  src=\"images/Uzbek musical instruments/Uzbek-dutar-musical-instrument.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></div><br />

<h2>Dutar technique</h2>

<p>The technique of playing the dutar is highly developed and is characterized by a complex rhythmic texture and an abundance of legato. The structure of the instrument varies from region to region, but is often quart.</p>

<p>The methods of playing the Uzbek dutar are somewhat different from the methods of playing the dombra and are distinguished by developed dash technique. Musicians play dutar, as well as on dombra - squealing, but not only with all fingers, but with three fingers alternately, or simultaneously. The strings are tuned differently, depending on the traditions of the performance of a particular play.</p>

<p>Uzbek dutar\'s repertoire is diverse - from small everyday plays to large makoms and dastans. Dutar is used as a solo, ensemble and a singing accompaniment instrument. It is widely used in home music playing (in particular, by women) and folk musicians-professionals. Based on the prevailing type of people\'s dutar in Uzbekistan in the mid-30\'s the family of orchestral dutars (prima, alto, bass, double bass) was formed.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"dutar Uzbek\"  src=\"images/Uzbek musical instruments/dutar-Uzbek.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<h2>Dutar is more than a play</h2>

<p>Today Uzbek musical instrument dutar continues to live and delight with its beautiful sounding, preserving in the 21st century its traditionality.</p>

<p>An ignorant man may think that dutar is a primitive thing: no pretentiousness, no art sophistication. However, the strictness and harmony of the lines of dutar is brought to a high level of art. And what skill should musician posses to share with the melodies of his soul playing only two strings!</p>

<p>If you listen to dutar, you feel the hot Uzbek sun, catch the many-voiced mountain streams, hear the screams of birds over the vast deserts.</p>

<p>The imprescriptible part of the musical culture of the Uzbek people is dutar. No celebration, be it a rural wedding or a state holiday, cannot do without the performances of folk singers. Played by folk musicians dutar can laugh and cry, passing all the shades of feelings, forcing the enchanted listeners to experience the happiness and tragedies of the heroes of the ancient dastans, to ponder over the depth of thought of the outstanding Uzbek poets.</p>

<p align=\"right\">The sound of a lone dutar is like a silent strings’ tear.<br />
The sound of a lone dutar is like a dumb and coward fear.</p>

<p>The oldest bow instrument that appeared on Uzbek land was gidjak.</p>

<p>Gidjak or gijjak (gijak) is a stringed bow musical instrument of the Uzbeks, as well as other peoples of Central Asia. It is also a \"close relative\" of the Persian kemanchi. The body of the instrument is spherical, covered with leather. It is made of pumpkin, large walnut, wood or other materials. The number of strings of gidjak is not constant, most often - four.</p>

<p>When playing Uzbek gidjak it is kept in an upright position, resting with a \"foot\" on the floor or knee. The sound is elicited with a short bow with a freely suspended string of horse hair, the tension of which is regulated by the fingers (nowadays a violin bow is often used). Songs and dances, instrumental pieces and separate parts from makoms are performed on gidjaks. Uzbek gidjak is used solo and in ensembles with other folk instruments.</p>

<p>Modern gidjak, which currently plays professionals, was adopted in the 50\'s of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Thanks to the richest expressive and technical capabilities, Uzbek gijjak today is one of the leading instruments of the orchestra, where it performs mostly a melodic role, and often participates in accompaniment and various kinds of echoes. There are different types of gidjak: gidjak-alto, gidjak bass, gidjak contrabass and gidjak prima.</p>

<p>A remarkable performer on gidjak was a well-known Uzbek musician and composer, a collector of musical folklore, who created many orchestral works based on folk melodies Tukhtasyn Jalilov. It is impossible without gidjak to present the work of the outstanding musician Yunus Rajabi - singer and performer, collector and researcher of Uzbek musical folklore, the author of the collection \"Uzbek folk music\" in five and six volumes.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek gidjak\"  src=\"images/Uzbek musical instruments/gidjak-uzbek.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></div><br />

<h2>History of Uzbek musical instrument gijjak</h2>

<p>Valuable information about the instrument is contained in the Persian musical treatise of the XIV century \"Kanz al-Tukhaf\" - \"The Gift of Treasures\". It has drawings. One depicts a gidjak, and the other - a rubab. The body of gidjak in the shape of the hemisphere is covered with leather. The long neck of gidjak is made of almond, walnut or even the strongest ebony. Both strings - zir and hadd - pass through the stand and are touched by a bow of horsehair (kamon). In the Maraga treatise, the same data on the technology of making a gijjak is supplemented by an indication that its body is also made of coconut shell and that the instrument sounds better if its strings are silk. They are usually configured in a quart, but other settings are possible. In addition to the main two strings, gidjak also has seven resonating strings.</p>

<p>Gidjak for miniatures of the XIV-XV centuries, especially for illustrations of \"Shahname\", is not typical. Nevertheless, there is every reason to assert that gidjak in the 15th century was a well-known instrument. One of the proofs is the miniature of the first half of the 15th century, belonging to the Herat or perhaps Samarkand art school. It depicts Uzbek gidjak with a body in the form of a hemisphere. In the hand of a woman there is a bow consisting of a short shaft and a strand of hair attached to it. The number of strings is indistinguishable, but judging by other images of this time, it can be assumed that there were two of them.</p>

<p>Modern Uzbek gijjak is the highest in terms of the sound volume of the instrument of the bow group. When you play it, use the four fingers of your left hand. The fingering of gidjak is like the fingering of a violin. The expressive capabilities of gidjak are exceptionally rich and varied. It is one of the most mobile instruments of the orchestra. It is suitable for performing the most diverse in terms of texture and tempo of passages. Gijjak, Uzbek music instrument, has a peculiar timbre of sound: the first string is shiny and light, the second and especially the third one is soft and tender, the bass (the fourth string) is deaf; its sound is not strong enough.</p>

<p>Note that the presented instrument can be heard live. During the <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">tour of Uzbekistan</a> famous performers and dance groups will please fans of the beautiful by their mastery of playing the Uzbek gidjak. Today this instrument, which has a thousand-year history, still sounds charming, like a thousand years ago.</p>

{{<p>At all times people devoted a part of their lives to culture. So, despite various difficult times, the inhabitants of Central Asia carried through the ages their musical culture. Thanks to akyns and connoisseurs of traditions, national instruments have reached our days practically in the form they were 100 and 200 years ago. Today the people of Uzbekistan can hear, play or simply hold in their hands the unique musical instruments which are typical of Central Asia.</p>

<p>Let\'s tell you about the Uzbek surnay in detail. And you in turn will certainly want to <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">visit Uzbekistan</a> and to hear the unusual sound of this national musical instrument.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek surnay\"  src=\"images/Uzbek musical instruments/Uzbek-surnay.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div>

<h2>Uzbek surnay: description of the instrument</h2>

<p>Uzbek surnay is a wind instrument of a smaller size than a karnay. The sound of surnay sounds a little like the sounds of a clarinet. As a rule, surnay and karnay always sound in pairs.</p>

<p>The body of Uzbek musical instrument surnay is stern with a wide mouth and is skillfully carved from a single piece of apricot or mulberry tree, and its metal pin is made of silver.</p>

<p>Surnay is an Uzbek national brass instrument, which has a form of a pipe. Surnay is wide at the base. Its length is about 45-55 cm. A small wooden tube is inserted in the narrow upper part of the instrument, which has a thin metal tube inside. This small tube is made of bamboo plates, surrounded by a metal ring. The metal pipe under the line has is a tiny plate “sadat”.<br />
<br />
The double reed of Uzbek surnay elicits sounds only if the artist uses a lot of effort. The positioning of the holes not only expands the sound range of the instrument, but also elicits clearer sounds.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Surnay\"  src=\"images/Uzbek musical instruments/surnay.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<h2>Surnay yesterday and surnay today</h2>

<p>Because of surnay’s strong sound, it became one of the dominant musical instruments. In Uzbekistan surnay is largely used in the ensembles. For example, a wedding ceremony, the birth of a child. A wide repertory of surnay can be explained by a wide diversity of its uses. As surnay is a singing instrument, it can perform a continuous legato too.</p>

<p>Plays for sunray are very diverse. There are subgroups of surnay in Uzbekistan: ritual, military, ceremonial and announcing.</p>

<p>Surnay sounds sharply, with a nasal hue. Therefore, previously the relative loudness of the sound allowed using surnay as a signaling instrument, with the help of which it was possible at the necessary moment to gather people for solemn or other ceremonies. Sometimes surnay was included in the military instrumental ensembles.</p>

Like a waterfall, they wash the soul from the superfluous husks of everyday life and small worries, taking it to the sources, where the harmony of spirit and the creative beginning of the universe reigns. As it turned out, this ancient instrument hides a lot of amazing secrets and mysteries. Modern researchers try to solve them.</p>

<p>Rubab or rubob (from Arab \"rabab\") in the classical sense is a stringed bow instrument of the Arab origin. It has a wooden convex case of round or oval shape, a leather deck, 4-6 intestinal, silk or metal strings, usually tuned in quarters, and resonating strings. The most common are rubabs of 800-1000 mm long. The sound is usually elicited by a plectrum. The orchestra of Uzbek folk instruments includes three varieties of rubobs: prima, alto, tenor.</p>

<p>There are varieties of rubabs in different peoples of the East: Afghan, Dulan, Kashgar, Pamir, and others. The most popular are Tajik (Afghan) and Kashgar rubabs. In Uzbekistan, the Afghan rubab got accustomed, or it is also called the Bukhara rubab. It is difficult now to determine the time when this instrument appeared in Uzbekistan. But it was depicted in miniatures of the XVII century. It is known that the Afghan rubab was used on the territory of Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kashmir, Iran, Pakistan and partly on the territory of India. It was also widely spread in Bukhara, the capital of the Bukhara khanate, located on the Great Silk Road.</p>

<p>As Sylvain Roy, the author of a number of books and articles on musical instruments in Central Asia, notes, probably, the Afghan rubab had taken root in Uzbekistan, since it was made from the mulberry tree, which is common in this area. And, as studies show, several varieties of rubab were used. So, if the classical Afghan rubab has four frets, then in the territory of Herat, which is closer to Iran, for example, one could find its variations with five or six frets. Everything depended on the repertoire in this or that region. So, for example, in <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Ferghana</a> the traditional wedding melody \"Yer-yer\" is performed with the help of one octave, in <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a> - one and a half octaves, and in Khorezm only five notes. It turns out that in accordance with the musical traditions of the local population, the musicians adapted this instrument for themselves.</p>

<h2>Types of Uzbek rubab and their differences</h2>

<p>The Afghan rubab stands out from the group of plectrum instruments, both by its external form, and by the unique timbre properties. The Afghan or Bukhara rubab in Uzbekistan is wedge-shaped, its case is large and deep with recesses on the sides and a short neck with a rounded head. The body and neck are hollowed out from one single piece of wood (most often mulberry). On the neck there is a fretboard, the lower end of which comes into the deck and closes the top of the case. The rest of the body is tightened with a leather membrane. The total length of the instrument is 70-80 cm. On the short and thick neck of rubab, there are 4 tie frets, and on the fretboard there are 6-7 additional frets, called khas-parda. Rubab has 5 main and 10-11 resonant strings. The basic strings are veined and are tuned in quarters as follows: the first and the second are in unison, the third and fourth - in unison and the fifth - independent. All the main strings are melodic. The resonant strings are located below the melodic; they are tuned in seconds and constitute a diatonic scale.<br />
<br />
The Afghan rubab is a melodic instrument and the plays on it are performed monodically. The instrument is complex and difficult to assimilate, the Afghan rubab, like the tanbur, is an instrument of folk-professional performers and it is used both as a soloist and in ensembles.<br />
<br />
The other Kashgar rubab is especially popular among Uzbek music lovers. This is connected, apparently, with a simple technique of performance and good sounding qualities.<br />
<br />
Kashgar rubab has a round form, it is tightened on top with a leather membrane with a long neck (dasta), ending with a bent head bent. At the base of the neck above the body there are 2 protrusions (8-10 cm long), resembling the animal\'s horns and thus giving the instrument an original form. The veined frets tied on the neck are in the number of 19-23 and constitute a chromatic scale. The number of strings on the Kashgar rubab is 5-3 silk and 2 copper. The main melodic string is the first (1-2), which is used as a melodic string, and the third one is tuning.</p>

<p>The diapason of the instrument is more than two octaves. In Uzbekistan Kashgar robab is the instrument both soloing and accompanying singing. It is also used for accompanying dances.</p>

<p>Kashgar rubab has a bright, light timbre of the first two metal strings and a little \"mat\", baritone - in the third, vein strings. In the upper register, the rubab sounds sharply, with a touch of nasal and very similar to the Caucasian tar.</p>

<h2>The Uzbek legend of the rubab</h2>

<p>If you look at Uzbek rubab in profile, you can see that the head of the instrument resembles the head of a peacock. An ancient legend says that a daughter of one Bukhara emir fell ill. Every day the young girl grew paler, the smile vanished from her face, and the best doctors from all over the country struggled in search of the cause of the ailment of the princess. And once the emir knew that an unusual musician came to Bukhara from Balkh. His music, people said, was able to heal any disease. The musician was called to the court and told about the misfortune that happened to the princess. After listening, he asked to give him a little time to make an instrument capable of extracting the music that could heal the soul of the princess. The master set to work in the palace garden, where there was a large and beautiful pond with peacocks walking nearby. Occasionally, a princess came out of the rooms and fed the birds from her hands. The birds proudly flapped their luxurious tails and walked leisurely around their beautiful mistress. From afar watching it, the musician did not notice how he fell in love with the princess. To please her, he made rubab, which in elegant forms was somewhat like the beloved birds of the princess. When the instrument was finally ready, the young man played it. The princess also heard the song of the soul, sitting in an arbour in the garden. She began to come to the arbour every day, to listen again and again to the music she loved. Soon the emir noticed that the princess\'s cheeks blushed again, her eyes sparkled with a flicker, and more often the emir heard the happy laughter of her beloved daughter in the palace. On the occasion of the recovery of the princess, emir decided to arrange a lavish holiday. He invited a talented musician to reward him and once again to hear the virtuoso play. Modestly located at the end of the palace hall, the young man played, looking for his beloved. She was sitting at the screen, but looked out curiously. Their eyes met for the first time, and the princess\'s heart beat in the rhythm of a melody pouring from the depths of the musician\'s soul. It was rumoured that this story was crowned by a magnificent wedding in the palace, which the loving father of the Bukhara princess arranged for lovers.</p>

<p>In the times of Abu Ali Ibn Sino (Avicenna), ae well as today in Uzbekistan rubab was considered an instrument of lovers.</p>

<p>It is curiously enough, but it is known that rubab is played in North Africa and in the southern provinces of Spain. It was borrowed to Europe in the 12th century under the name of rebek. In Turkey there is a three-stringed rubab. The Persians call rubab \"rabet barbitus\".</p>

<p>Today the connoisseurs of beauty can play Uzbek musik rubab. They are few, but if you want to hear a truly beautiful melody performed on rubab, <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">travel to Uzbekistan</a>. The company Peopletravel will be glad to assist in this.</p>

{{<p>Each people of our planet has its own rituals, which have been formed over the centuries. Uzbek customs have come into current life, having retained their identity and diversity.</p>

<h2>Formation of Uzbek traditions</h2>

<p>Uzbek ethnicity, in scientists\' judgment, is considered one of the oldest ethnic groups in our world, so Uzbek customs and traditions have a long history. Many traditions and customs are preserved thanks to the fact that everyone, regardless of origin or status, considered and considers it its duty to comply with them.</p>

<p>Uzbek ethnic group is one of the oldest, brightest and most multiple in Central Asia. Acres in the upper reaches of <a href=\"[[~2838]]\" target=\"_blank\">the Amu Darya</a>, <a href=\"[[~2839]]\" target=\"_blank\">Syr Darya</a> and in the foothills of the <a href=\"[[~2670]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tien-Shan</a> have always been on the ethno-cultural component from the other regions of Central Asia. The locals in the IV century BC went from a nomadic to a settled way of life, so at dawn of civilization distinctive cultural and public structure of the society, which has not changed for centuries, was formed here. Only with the advent of Islam, some aspects of Uzbek culture have undergone some changes, but Islam soon joined organically into the local culture than vanquished it.</p>

<p>The ancient Iranian peoples, later, the nomadic Turkic tribes, then the Chinese and Russian made contribution to the culture of Uzbekistan.</p>

<h2>Uzbek National House</h2>

<p>The main peculiarities of the Uzbek family are cordiality and traditionally respectful esteem to elders. The Uzbeks commonly live in large families, so preference is shown to big ground-mounted houses. Traditional Uzbek house (often two-story with open verandah) is built around the periphery of a courtyard, planted with fruit trees.</p>

<p>Living room (mekhmon khona) in the house is usually a very large and elegantly decorated room. Before dinner the hosts spread kurpachi (small embroidered mattresses), and family members have dinner sitting on them. In good weather, the whole family is resting or sleeping on the couch, set in the yard. The rule in Uzbekistan culture is to accept invitations. Respectable guests are greeted at the gates of the owners; they are greeted and invited into the house.</p>

<p>Tea is offered here as before as after any meal. Initially, the table is laid with sweets, pastries, dried fruit and nuts, fruits and vegetables and snacks; and only after all dishes a customary pilaf and other food are served. Hot cakes should be in the cuisine, which in no case should not be turned over. It is not a good omen to let a piece of cake fall.</p>

<p>Tea and tea ceremony take a certain place in Uzbek rituals. Brewing this really a main drink of the country, as well as pouring it to guests, is the prerogative of men. Tea is infused in a small pot and poured into small bowls. The traditional Uzbek special appeal of the hospitality here is characteristically small quantity of tea. The more honorable guest, the less drink is in his tea bowl. This nonsense is explained very simply. The guest will more frequently ask for the additive and the guest will be given more attention.</p>

<p>Peopletravel suggests a traveler <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbekistan trips</a> and to visit the real Uzbek home in Uzbekistan that he or she can see Uzbekistan culture and traditions and feel the warmth and benevolence of the true Uzbeks.

Neighbors will always help, if you need to organize any festival, prepare pilaf, to tidy a street. Usually everybody takes up the call.</p>

<h2>Types of Uzbek traditions and rituals</h2>

{{<p>The child’s birth from any people has long been surrounded by a lot of rituals. They emerged not only to express the joy of parents and other relatives to the continuation of their clan, but also to guard the baby from the influence of evil forces. One of these rituals is beshik toyi that is spread among the peoples of Central Asia, and in Uzbekistan, in particular.</p>

<p>Beshik item itself is a cradle for a baby. Beshik toyi, the festivity on the occasion of the first putting down the child in the cradle, is considered one of the most widespread ancient family rites in Uzbekistan. This rite is held mainly on the seventh, ninth, eleventh day after the birth of the child or any other day with the mutual parental consent of the newlyweds. The difference between Beshik toyi and other family rites is that men do not participate in it, and only women take part in the ritual.</p>

<p>As a rule, Uzbek Beshik toyi is held for the first-born, and it passes solemnly. In some districts local names are used for its designation. By way of example, in <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a>, the ritual is named \"Govora bandon\" - \"Tie in beshik\"; in Khorezm - \"Buvak yigilish\".</p>

<p>Under the old tradition, the grandmother of the newborn on mother’s side buys a beshik (Uzbek wooden cradle) decorates it, and also prepares everything necessary for the baby. The day before Beshik toyi mother-in-law sent her son-in-law a beautifully adorned basket full of cakes, sweets and toys. Gifts and treats wrapped in a tablecloth were carried along the street, accompanied by tambourines of carnai-surnais (<a href=\"[[~2845]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbek national music instruments</a>). In many places (particularly, in <a href=\"[[~190]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tashkent</a>) for a baby (if it was a boy) a foal was dressed. For grandfathers and grandmothers of the baby outfits (sarpa) were prepared.</p>

<p>On the day of beshik toyi, having met mother\'s relatives, flour was strewn onto their faces as a symbol of their pure thoughts, wishes to the child happiness. At this time in the other room the rite of putting the baby in the beshik was held.</p>

<p>Now Beshik toyi in Uzbekistan is held at a certain time. According to the ritual, the closest relatives of the son-in-law arrive, saying inherent sentences. In turn, a woman who receives guests or one of the elderly women, introduces a specially decorated Uzbek beshik. After this the son-in-law\'s father \"buys\" the beshik. Then arriving guests are invited into the house and seated at a specially laid table. At the table prayers are made for the well-being of the child. In some regions, special long noodles are cooked at the festival. It reflects the desire of the child for a long life, like noodles. After the feast there are funs and dances, and close relatives of the baby give him various gifts. In turn, the parents of the son-in-law also distribute gifts to the guests, which were specially prepared for them.</p>

<p>In Khorezm for Beshik toyi special women – performers of khalf were invited. They performed for the audience the fragments from the Uzbek folk epics, and also told stories and legends.</p>

<p>In earlier times, a special dish prepared from jugara was served on the beshik ritual, because jugara was considered by the Uzbeks as a symbol of fertility. Now various sweets (parvarda or sugar) and special pilaf are cooked.</p>

<p>At the end of the Beshik toyi ceremony, on the left of the young mother the beshik (cradle) is put. The mother breast-feeds the child and sings to him a lullaby. According to the views of the Uzbeks two things are important for a child: mother\'s milk and a lullaby. For this reason, girls from an early age learn to sing a lullaby.</p>

<p>After the execution of all the rituals associated with Beshik toyi, the guests are seen off. With this, the rite ends.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"beshik toyi in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbek traditions/beshik-toyi.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div>

<h2>Uzbek cradles in the past</h2>

<p>Such cradles were used in the era of nomadic life. They were made in the following way: two arches of willow wood with a thick wrist were joined with sticks, which were inserted into the holes at the ends of the arches. Bands stretched from the willow were weaved between the sticks, and a small mattress was spread over the bottom.</p>

<p>Subsequently, the construction of the Uzbek cradle was improved. The cradle was made with a cultuk - a hole that was connected with the pot. Thanks to this the child stayed dry longer and the mother was less distracted from work to care for him. In addition, rocking pads were made in beshik, so that the child could be quickly soothed by motion sickness.</p>

<h2>Manufacture of beshiks in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>The production of cradles for babies (beshiks) is done by the egarchi. This is considered an independent trade. This profession requires creative imagination, knowledge of folk traditions, and love of craft. Most often this profession is considered to be a job of the third generation.</p>

<p>There is no special factory for beshiks’ production in Uzbekistan. Everything is done in private houses in mahallas (Uzbek neighborhoods) or at private enterprises.</p>

<p>Beshik is a structure from a rectangular base with no legs. From the base up there are two arch-shaped vaults, which serve for the formation and stability of the structure. At the bottom of the beshik, soft feather beds or a mattress are laid, and on the top of the crib the tulle is hung.</p>

<p>Uzbek cradle is made of poplar. To make a beshik you need to take wood without damage. The components of the cradle are ground on special equipment. Thinner parts are made by hand. After manufacturing the beshik, it must stand in the sun, so that the wood becomes dry, and the parts are elastic. If the ready beshik does not dry, after a while it can become unusable.<br />
<br />
If the process of making the Uzbek beshik is a family affair, then in the manufacture of the cradle, the duties are distributed as follows: men polish the tree, women paint cradles.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"beshik toyi traditions in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbek traditions/beshik-toyi-traditions.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<p>Initially it is covered with a colorless varnish. Next, the finished product is applied with a color varnish and gilding. Drawings on beshiks for boys and girls are different. For boys’ beshiks geometric shapes are used more, for girls’ ones there are smooth lines and patterns.</p>

{{<p>Kurash is the most ancient kind of single combat, which roots are on the territory of Uzbekistan of today. The age of Kurash is at least three and a half thousand years. Kurash in translation means \"achieving the goal honestly\".</p>

<h2>History of kurash</h2>

<p>Mentions of Kurash can be found in many ancient papers. The Uzbek national wrestling \"kurash\" has a bright, interesting history. In ancient eastern sources kurash is referred to a spectacular single combat. The famous Hungarian scholar L. Kun noted that kurash had its own ancient history.</p>

<p>In the permanent places of residence of the ancient man, along with scenes of hunting, images of struggling people began to appear. In particular, images of a fighter with high technique were found on wall drawings of Egyptian pyramids. A bronze statuette, made around the ХХVIII century BC, is the oldest monument of \"belbogli kurash\" (a kind of kurash in which wrestlers compete holding each other’s belts)</p>

<p>Several historical sources and archaeological sites confirm that in our region kurash has been practiced since ancient times. The well-known archeologist S.P. Tolstov in his archaeological research, conducted in Janbaskala (Khorezm), determined that in the IV century BC among the tribal communities, kurash was widely spread. It was during this research when the statuettes of competing wrestlers were found. In the monument of Koikyrylgankala a riton with a depiction of kurash wrestling dating back to the 4th-3rd centuries BC was found. Tolstov asserts that our ancestors conducted kurash competitions during various festivities, especially on the day of Navruz.</p>

<p>In such invaluable examples of oral folk creativity of the Uzbek people, like epics \"Alpamysh\", \"Gogogly\", \"Tulganoy\", wrestlers, their strength and courage were glorified. In the epic \"Alpamysh\" the competitions of Uzbek wrestlers, their technique, dexterity are very brightly illustrated.</p>

<p>In the 10th century the kurash technique was improved. In ancient Chinese source \"Tan-shu\" it was noted that Ferghana residents who went on festivities dedicated to the holiday \"Navruz\" shared in two groups and began to compete in kurash.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbekistan kurash\"  src=\"images/Uzbek traditions/Uzbekistan-kurash.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<p>The great scholar Abu Ali ibn Sino (980-1037), speaking of kurash, noted: \"Kurash differed in species. One of its species was belbogli kurash, according to the rules of which the wrestlers had each other for the belt. In any case, they did not release their hands from the opponent\'s belt and fought to victory.\" The great commander Amir Timur, in order to increase the physical strength of his soldiers, taught them to use various methods of kurash. Thus, kurash acquired a mass significance.<br />
<br />
Ages passed, and Uzbek kurash became one of the most loved and honored traditions among the peoples. To date, there are more than two million kurash wrestlers throughout Uzbekistan.</p>

<h2>Kurash as a national kind of sport</h2>

<p><a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a>, <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a>, <a href=\"[[~339]]\" target=\"_blank\">Khiva</a> - all the main trade routes of Asia, and the Great Silk Road, passed through these cities. There were touched, mutually enriching each other, a variety of cultures - Chinese, Indian, Iranian, Arab, the culture of nomadic peoples of the Asian steppes. In the time of Tamerlane, Uzbekistan became a center of the Muslim world. Is it any wonder that the customs of the Uzbeks and their close and distant neighbors have much in common. For example, the national Uzbek wrestling kurash in different variations exists among almost all Turkic peoples. So, sooner or later, kurash should have been formed as an independent sport.</p>

<p>The technique, rules and philosophy of kurash were passed by word of mouth. No tries were made to systematize and generalize knowledge about kurash until 1990, when Komil Yusupov, the famous master of kurash, completed this kind of research. He developed new general rules of kurash. He instituted weight categories, gestures and terminology based on 13 Uzbek words, the duration of the fight, the form for athletes and judges, and everything else without which modern sports cannot be imagined.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek kurash\"  src=\"images/Uzbek traditions/Uzbek-kurash.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div>

<h2>Rules of kurash</h2>

<p>In kurash fighting in the supine position is banned. It is possible to fight only in the rack. All this makes Uzbek kurash a simple, understandable, gripping, dynamic and harmless kind of sport.</p>

<p>All throws made in the rack, the judges judge. If the rivals\' scores are the same, the victory is awarded based on the last award. If the participant received both an evaluation and punishment, an advantage is given to the evaluation.</p>

<p>Kurash is an extremely spectacular sport. For passivity a wrestler is severely punished. If within 25 seconds the wrestler does not attempt to hold a reception, the judge announces a warning to him. Three warnings mean a loss.</p>

<p>The appearance of kurash on the world stage as an international sport has further increased the interest in this sport from authoritative sports organizations and countries of the world community.</p>

<p>Probably, there is no man who at least once did not try his hand at the national struggle – kurash in Uzbekistan. Regularly about 2 million people are occupied by the kind of sport in the republic.</p>

<p>Uzbek wrestling attracts people primarily because it is devoid of any aggression. This art is not to maim and kill, but to rejoice in the beauty and perfection of movements.&nbsp;</p>

{{<p>Uzbek national clothing is a whole layer of Uzbek culture, which is given much attention in modern Uzbekistan. Practically in each region there are several museums with expositions of clothes from different eras. Special attention should be paid to the fact that unlike the medieval clothes of the European peoples, the national dress of the people of Uzbekistan, having evolved in everyday life, is still used by most of the rural population to this day.</p>

<h2>History of Uzbek clothing</h2>

<p>The clothes of the Uzbeks’ ancestors living on the territory of Uzbekistan have been forming in accordance with the peculiarities of natural conditions, way of life and tribal traditions. Archaeological miniatures of manuscripts preserved until our time give a fairly clear idea of ​​the Uzbek traditional clothing, its forms and evolution.</p>

<p>The main factor that influenced the ethnic clothing of the Uzbeks, of course, was Islam. Therefore, the toilet items were wide, long, whole-cut, designed to freely fall and completely cover the human body. Traditional Uzbek clothing continued to preserve features of archaism until the 20th century. Men\'s, women\'s and even children\'s clothes were practically the same in form and cut.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek clothing\"  src=\"images/Uzbek traditions/Uzbek-clothing.jpg\" width=\"700\" /></div>

<h2>Uzbek men’s clothing</h2>

Kuilak - the lower male shirt of straight cut, and ishton - wide trousers that narrow to the bottom, are dressed on the body. Legs are shod in boots made of thin leather.</p>

<p>Dressing gowns – chapans are sewed from striped material, have vertical cuts on the sides. Pockets and buttons are not foreseen. Chapans are summer from thin fabric or winter, warm, quilted with cotton.</p>

<p>The population of the plains oases wore soft boots along with leather shoes without backs. At the time of equestrian running the Uzbek nobility wore smart boots, the graceful heel of which was skewed to the middle of the sole, allowing the rider to keep in the stirrups deftly.</p>

<p>The skullcap - duppi is the final attribute of the Uzbek male costume. This hat is more a tribute to the traditions of Islam than protection from bad weather.</p>

{{<h2>Concept of Uzbek traditional music and its history</h2>

<p>It has happened that from time immemorial Uzbek music and song are accompanied by all the customs and rituals during the significant events from birth to the end.</p>

<p>In many Uzbek families, traditional ritual music, in particular, songs, filled with a special meaning, often originated from the era of pre-Islamic pagan culture, are carefully preserved and transferred.</p>

<p>The scientist Narshakhi in his work \"History of Bukhara\" noted the art of the Sogdians, who performed ancient ritual songs.</p>

<p>Of course, Uzbek music is not restricted to ceremonial and ritual songs. Until now, the ancient song genres \"kushik\", \"lapar\", \"yalla\", based on the poetic texts, performed accompanied by dances, are very popular.</p>

<p>The dastans - epic tales of lyrical and heroic content take a particular place in the Uzbek musical heritage.</p>

<p>Professionalism in the Uzbek musical art was constituted in early millennium AD. Musicians were famous for their high performing skills in a variety of genres.</p>

<p>Ancient Uzbek music, dances, musical instruments, performers penetrated into China, Korea, Japan as a dowry of royal brides, diplomatic offerings and other ways. Historical sources point out the popularity of Sogdian musicians in China, in particular, the unprecedented success of the orchestra from Ango (<a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a>) of the Sui dynasty in the 6th-7th centuries AD.</p>

<p>In the Dark Ages, the traditional music-vocal Uzbek genre \"makom\" was formed. It is rightly considered the pinnacle of Uzbek professional music of oral tradition. Probably, initially at certain times of the day, during the change of the guards, a special ritual music called \"makom\" was performed over the serf or city gates. Makom in Arabic means \"location\".</p>

<p>Uzbek musical culture originated in ancient times. This is evidenced by the monuments of material culture found on the territory of Uzbekistan. Uzbek music is closely connected with the musical culture of the whole Central Asia, but at the same time it is deeply original. In the musical heritage of the Uzbek people, as well as many other peoples of the East, there are two large strata - folklore (actually national arts) and the professional art of oral tradition (makoms and other products of developed form).</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek traditional music\"  src=\"images/Uzbek traditions/Uzbek-traditional-music.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div>

<h2>Styles of Uzbek folk music</h2>

<p>In Uzbek folk and professional music, there are four basic local styles - Khorezm, Bukhara-Samarkand, Fergana-Tashkent, Surkhandarya-Kashkadarya. They were the result of ethnic community and similarity of social and economic living conditions of the population of certain regions (zones) of Uzbekistan in past centuries. Zones differ from each other in some features of everyday life, certain song and instrumental genres, musical instruments. For example, in the Bukhara and Khorezm zones makoms were widely used, while in the Surkhandarya and Kashkadarya regions, plays for dombra were darious and worthy, while in the Ferghana Valley there were various song genres with musical and poetic characteristics of the locality. The genre of katta-ashula, or panys-ashula, is exclusively of <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Fergana</a> and <a href=\"[[~190]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tashkent</a>.</p>

<h2>Uzbek music in antiquity</h2>

<p>Professionalism in the musical art of Uzbekistan, as in other countries of Asia, was formed in ancient times. The famous carriers and creators of genres of professional monodies were outstanding musicians of the 6th-8th centuries. They are Barbat, Ibrahim al-Mausili, his son Iskhak al-Mausili and others. The theoretical foundations of traditional music were elucidated in treatises by scholars of the East - Abu Nasr Muhammad al-Farabi (9-10 centuries), Abu Ali Hussein Ibn Sina (10-11 centuries), Ibn Zayla (11 century), Khorezmi (11 century), Safi-ad-din Urmavi (13 century), Mahmud ash-Shirazi (13 century), Abdul Qadira Maragi (14 century), Abdurahman Jami (15 century), And later Zaynula-Biddin Khusaini (16 century), Darvesh Ali Changi 16-17 centuries) and many other Central Asian anonymous authors of the 16-19 centuries.</p>

<p>The complexity of the genres and performing traditions of professional oral musical culture of Uzbekistan required from singers and instrumentalists many years of preparation. The musicians studied with famous masters, united in corporations, each of which had its own rules - risola. Everything was learned \"from the voice\". Note chronicle, known in middle centuries (on the tracts of Farabi, ash-Shirazi, etc.), in the musical practice was not applied. Even the Khorezm tablature (or notation), invented in the third quarter of the 19th century, came into use of only a narrow circle of musicians, although with the help of it makoms were written.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"traditional Uzbek music\"  src=\"images/Uzbek traditions/traditional-Uzbek-music.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div>

<h2>Modern Uzbek music</h2>

<p>After joining Central Asia to Russia (1868), in spite of the colonial policy of the tsarist autocracy, the influence of progressive Russian science and culture penetrates into Uzbekistan. In the 80-90\'s. (and later) Russian societies of music lovers were established in Uzbek cities: the Tashkent Musical Society, the Tashkent Choral Society \"Lira\" (1898, under the guidance of the military bandmaster V. V. Leysek), the <a href=\"[[~578]]\" target=\"_blank\">Margelan</a> Musical Society (under the direction of D.I. Mikhailov), the <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a> Musical Society (early 90s), etc. Concerts were organized by the newly created Russian collectives - symphony orchestra, chamber ensembles, opera companies, and barnstormers. An important role in the propaganda of music belonged to military brass bands that appeared everywhere. All this had a positive effect on the evolution of the Uzbek national musical culture.</p>

<p>The creative community of composers of different nationalities and different generations was especially pronounced during the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45. Thereat the song genre came to the fore.</p>

<p>During the war years, the musical life of Uzbekistan was also strained, especially Tashkent, where people were evacuated from Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and other cities.</p>

<p>A 3-year stay of Leningrad conservatory in Tashkent contributed the development of musical culture of the republic. Despite the difficulties of the military years the Musical-Drama Theater in Yangiyul (1941) and the music school in Samarkand (1944) were opened.</p>

<p>In the postwar years, special attention was paid to the further expansion of the network of musical and educational institutions, the creation and strengthening of performers and collectives. The orchestra of folk instruments, the Uzbek radio and television (1947), the choral chapel at the Uzbek Philharmonic were formed.</p>

<p>The new area for Uzbek composers and their music was the cinematography, the best samples of which are Burkhanov\'s music (to the films \"Bai and the farmhand\", \"Avicenna\", \"The Road to the Horizon\"); Akbarov’s music (to the films \"Hamza\", \"You are not an orphan\"); Yudakov’s music (to the film \"Furkat\"); Vilzanov’s music (to the films \"White, white storks\", \"One among the people\"), etc.</p>

<p>Musical composers of Uzbekistan widely refer to the folklore of not only Uzbeks, but also other peoples living in the territory of the republic.</p>

[[$SmartargetWhatsappContactUs]]}}

{{<p>Almost all <a href=\"[[~2860]]\" target=\"_blank\">holidays in Uzbekistan</a> are accompanied by grandiose folk festivals. This tradition is rooted in deep antiquity, so far our people with pleasure and enthusiasm celebrate all significant events together. Our ancestors raised their strength and dexterity, they were good riders and accurate riflemen. That is why it has become a tradition to organize various entertainment events, competitions, contests and performances of art masters.</p>

<p>\"Kupkari\", the competition of riders is incredibly spectacular. Kupkari in Uzbekistan is also called Uak, Ulak Kupkari, Buzkashi or Uzgashi, which in translation means \"tearing the goat\" - the most common and popular equestrian sport among the peoples of Central Asia.</p>

<p>This game is allowed to be played only by men on horseback. Usually the number of participants varies from 50 to 300 people. Experienced riders compete for a goat or young sheep. The winner must come to the finish line, not allowing other riders to select the prey.</p>

<p>A man who has never seen Uzbek ulak is unable to imagine the swiftness and tension unfolding in the vast field of struggle. Riders then rush in avalanche after one of the players, then, surrounding him, turn into a living, winding, like a tornado, a tangle of snoring horse faces, flashing hoofs and human figures, clutching their hands in the object of the claims - the goat carcass. Beginners, first watching ulak, are amazed with the intensity of the struggle of players and the rapid expression of emotions by fans.</p>

<h2>Kupkari rules</h2>

<p>Ulak-kupkari horse riding competition begins with the moment when players line up in a single line, while the bakaulbashi (referee) at this time prepares the carcass and places it in the center of the field. Each participant must solemnly swear that he will play fair: he will not attack the opponent from the back, will not run a horse against the bending opponent and will not use metal objects.</p>

<p>After the bakaulbashi gives a signal, the riders jump to the center of the field and try to raise it. The rider must lift the carcass, secure it, pressing to the side of the horse and rush to the finish line. A horseman must make one circle on the square, without losing the loot, bring it to the finish. The finish in Uzbek is translated as “marra”. A spacious field is the venue. At a distance of one and a half kilometers there are two finish spots. Large prizes are intended for the upper finish, and smaller for the lower finish. Marra is a platform with a diameter of up to 20 meters. It is denoted by sprinkling straw or lined stones. The kupkari rider must throw the goat’s carcass in this circle. The winner is the horseman who throws the trophy in the circle. Sharp mind, tremendous dexterity, powerful strength and ability to merge with a horse bring success to the winner. In earlier times, the champion received generous prizes. It could be camels, carpets, valuable items or money. Today, the prize can be household appliances or even a car.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Ulak-kupkari\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/Ulak-kupkari.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div>

<h2>Preparing horses for kupkari</h2>

<p>Competitors prepare for the competition of kupkari in advance. They choose a strong horse of great endurance. In addition, the horse should be short to facilitate the lifting of the animal carcass from the ground, since at the height of the battle it often falls to the ground.</p>

<p>The kupkari riders train their horses before the important day, so that the horses know how to get closer to the carcass, how to get ahead of the rival\'s horse, how to push, how to turn sideways.</p>

<p>Particular attention is paid to feeding horses. The horse cannot be overfed. A strict diet is established.</p>

<p>Oriental horses have always been famous all over the world. So, back in 104 BC, Chinese emperors sent their envoys to the territory of the <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Fergana Valley</a> for the famous “heavenly horses”, which were strong and powerful in stature, and also distinguished by their unique endurance.</p>

<p>The horses of the Zarafshan Valley, the Karabair racers since ancient times used special honor.</p>

<h2>Outfit of participants during ulak-kupkari Uzbek national game</h2>

<p>Riders or “chavandoz” wear wide quilted robes and pants, high boots, helmets and fur hats to protect themselves from the blows of their rivals, as well as to keep tight clothing from holding down movement.</p>

<p>Special requirements are imposed on equipping horses. Their bridles to avoid injury to the participants of the game should be without metal jewelry, and stirrups - smooth. No horses with spikes on horseshoes are allowed on the field.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"kupkari\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/kupkari.JPG\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<p>Usually in Uzbekistan the competition kupkari is arranged in the offseason, at the time of weddings and other major celebrations. In the days of the celebration of <a href=\"[[~3119]]\" target=\"_blank\">Navruz</a>, the game kupkari is most popular among the Uzbeks.

Each type has its own characteristics. But the most popular and spectacular is the traditional, ulak wedding game. Hundreds and thousands of foreign tourists try to see it.</p>

{{<p>Every journey, wherever you go, has its own peculiarities and unusual moments. Uzbekistan is no exception. For example, Uzbekistan may surprise the traveler with its unusual rites or national entertainments. One of such <a href=\"[[~3462]]\" target=\"_blank\">amusements in Uzbekistan</a> is ram battle.</p>

<p>Sheep fighting is an ancient tradition that spread among the peoples of Asia, in particular Uzbekistan. It differs from the famous bullfight in that the person participates in the process as a spectator and does not physically intervene in the fight. The structure of the battle resembles a similar struggle of dogs, roosters, camels and other species.</p>

<p>Usually in any animal battles, males are involved because their instinct of fighting is well developed. In nature, they fight for females and territory. They are aggressive in nature, determined to fight with a representative of their own gender and are better suited for battle. Rams are no exception. Strong hollow horns, great weight, physical strength and desire to win became the key to the popularity and entertainment of sheep fighting in Uzbekistan.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"sheep fighting\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/sheep fighting.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div>

<h2>Ram battle process</h2>

<p>Fighters are pulled apart and placed opposite each other at a distance of at least five meters. This ensures acceleration and impact force. Then the owners let the pets go and move aside. After the first collision, the opponents immediately disperse and move back in different directions in order to accelerate again and face their foreheads. The hosts do not affect the course of the battle; they are present as observers and fans.</p>

<p>Another factor that decides the outcome of the Uzbek sheep fight is the loss of the horns of one opponent. Then it steps aside, admitting defeat, and refuses to continue the fight, despite the master\'s prodding. Victory is recognized for the participant who did not retreat or did without loss.</p>

<p>The sheep, recognized as the winner of fighting, is covered with a red carpet to the applause of the public. It symbolizes triumph.</p>

<p>An animal is preparing for combat as a true athlete: special food, jogging and training. It is also very important to keep the animal clean and follow all the rules of hygiene.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"sheep fighting in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/sheep-fighting-in-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div><br />

<p>More often, ram battles in Uzbekistan are held on the days of the celebration of <a href=\"[[~3119]]\" target=\"_blank\">Navruz</a>. Such a traditional game is in Navruz custom.</p>

<p>Peopletravel Company is glad to prepare for you a unique <a href=\"[[~1]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbek tour program</a>, during which you can get acquainted with the <a href=\"[[~2871]]\" target=\"_blank\">traditions of the Uzbeks</a> and get to the national games and shows.</p>

{{<p>In Uzbekistan, there are many national games and amusements that will surely please even the sophisticated bettor. One of such Uzbek game is cockfighting, which is very popular all over the world.</p>

<p>Cockfighting in Uzbekistan is an old fun game that has remained relevant to this day. Cockfight can be considered the most gambling <a href=\"[[~3462]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbek fun</a>.</p>

<p>Cockfight is a competition of specially trained roosters, who are set on fighting with each other; a gambling sport in which observers are betting on the victory of one of the roosters. Cockfights in Uzbekistan in many ways are like boxing fights and consist of short rounds, which can continue until the owners agree on the result of a draw.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Cockfighting\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/Cockfighting.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<p>Roosters of a special breed participate in battles, which are specially prepared for dangerous bouts. No wonder that roosters are considered the most cocky and proud birds.</p>

<p>Before the fight, the feathered birds warm up like real professional boxers. The owner of the rooster courts his pet. He massages the wings of a rooster, cleans his beak and arranges a kind of shower for the cock: he takes water into his mouth and sprays the bird, thereby cooling it before another fight. Roosters express their superiority over the enemy with aggressive attacks, inflicting precise blows with their beaks. Sometimes one, three or four pairs of roosters are released on an improvised ring. The cockfight lasts an average of several minutes.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that in modern times the judges do not allow a fatal outcome, and the victory is awarded to the most active rooster.</p>

<h2>\"Dakan\" - Uzbek fighting cocks</h2>

<p>The time of the creation of the breed and the original form is unknown. On the territory of Uzbekistan, fighting cocks “kulangi” were bred from deep antiquity. In the <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Fergana Valley</a> they are known as “dakan”. The selection of roosters was carried out by aggressiveness, massiveness of the body, the strength of the constitution with poor feeding.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek cockfights\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/Uzbek cockfights.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<p>Kulangi is a large fighting bird with a small head, slightly flat from the sides, with developed superciliary arches, almost without a crest. Its beak is short, curved and strong; its lobes are small and pink; the gills are mild, red or absent. The neck is long, muscular; the wings fit snugly to the body; the legs are long, strong and widely spaced with long tarsus.</p>

<p>The temperament of such kind of Uzbek dakan cock is lively and aggressive. These dakan roosters are easy to train; fighting qualities are developed. The cock is adapted to the hot climate.</p>

<p>These Uzbek cockfights are spectacular and popular, they are loved by both residents of Uzbekistan and numerous tourists. It’s possible to watch the fights of roosters in Uzbekistan while traveling around <a href=\"[[~163]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbek cities</a>. Peopletravel agency is eager to arrange for you such kind of catching <a href=\"[[~1]]\" target=\"_blank\">tour in Uzbekistan</a>!</p>

{{<h2>Green zones and parks of Tashkent. General information</h2>

<p>Tashkent is one of the greenest capitals in the world. <a href=\"[[~190]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tashkent</a> mysteriously manages to combine harmoniously all possible variety of capital functions. It is the historical, cultural, educational, administrative and trade center of Uzbekistan. Everywhere the national color is intertwined with modern technologies. But the most pleasant for the traveler in Tashkent is the excellent conditions for rest in all its manifestations.</p>

<p>There are a lot of parks and open space in Tashkent. You can always find an excuse to go to the park to breathe fresh air and enjoy the sun\'s rays or just walk in the shade of perennial trees. There are also many sports grounds and children\'s attractions.</p>

<p>Even in the past Tashkent was famous for its park areas. Now when looking at Tashkent, you see a large garden, which here and there covers low buildings. The city is immersed in abundance of ​​greenery. The first city park in Tashkent was founded in April 1882.</p>

<p>Approximately 35 percent of Tashkent\'s area is covered with greenery: trees, flowers, bushes, etc. In total, there are 18 large park zones in Tashkent, besides innumerable small gardens.</p>

<p>The abundance of the most diverse gardens and parks in Tashkent is able to please every taste. It\'s amazing, but it turns out that the capital city can be calm and cozy thanks to a great deal of wonderful parks and rest places!</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Tashkent green zones\" height=\"627\" src=\"images/Tashkent parks/tashkent-green-zones.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></p>

<h2>Fauna on the green islands of Tashkent</h2>

<p>Scientists estimated that 180 species of vertebrates are found within the capital of Uzbekistan. Most of them are birds, followed by mammals related to orders of bats, rodents and predators.</p>

<p>On the left bank of the <a href=\"[[~2840]]\" target=\"_blank\">river Chirchik</a> in the Bektemir district of Tashkent is a magnificent golf club. About half of its well-groomed territory is occupied by water bodies, the rest consists of numerous dazzlingly beautiful golf courses interspersed with picturesque groves. When you get here, you forget that you are in a large city. In winter, a large number of waterfowl accumulates on the ice-free areas of water bodies with running water. They are coot, various kinds of ducks. There is a graceful large white heron. On the man-made overgrown island in the golf club, the handsome pheasants have settled and feel at home, and a rather large colony of quakva, a relative of the heron quack, has appeared on the trees. By the way, only a few settlements of these funny birds are known on the territory of Uzbekistan. Here also regularly occur small cormorants.</p>

<p>Of course, life does not stand still, times change. Now in the outskirts of Tashkent you will not find the Turanian tiger, as in the XIX century. Now, to meet a snow leopard, a bear, a wild boar, a roe deer or a wolf, you need to drive from the capital for 40-60 kilometers to the mountains.</p>

<p>But, getting on the \"green island\", you often catch yourself thinking that, despite everything, we remained a part of nature and really want to breathe in full.</p>

<br />

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Anсhor lokomotiv park\"  src=\"images/Tashkent parks/anсhor-lokomotiv-park.jpg\" width=\"940\" /></div><br />

<p>According to the administration of the Anchor Lokomotiv Park, more than 42 kartings of four types were purchased: children, for beginners, as well as training and professional machines. According to the ideas, the new karting track should give an inexpressible feeling to vacationers from fast driving, and experienced instructors monitor the safety at the site.</p>

<p>In the new Tashkent park “Anchor Lokomotiv” there are a lot of different attractions that can hardly be found in other similar places of rest of the townspeople.

<p>Nearby is an artificial pond with an area of ​​1810 square meters. The creators of the park with interest approached the idea of ​​boats and catamarans. Stylized for red retro cars and white swans, they smoothly dissect through an artificial reservoir. An overview pedestrian bridge passes through the pond.</p>

<p>In addition, guests are greeted by a large fountain with multi-colored lanterns, a children\'s restaurant, many sites for the youngest guests of the park, various cafes and many other interesting places and areas for children\'s games and fun. Also free parking for cars is available to all visitors of the Anchor Lokomotiv Park in Tashkent.</p>

<p>Another notable point in the new recreation area is that the creators have installed here architectural models of seven historical sights and symbols of the <a href=\"[[~163]]\" target=\"_blank\">cities of Uzbekistan</a>.

{{<p>Uzbek national arts and crafts have long enjoyed a well-deserved fame. The historical conditions, in which the culture of the Uzbek people developed, predetermined applied art a special role. For many centuries the people created its technical and artistic traditions. Applied art is genre, the main feature of which is a deep connection of artistic creativity and material needs. The organic fusion of the artistic and practically necessary creates an indissoluble unity of ideologically- artistic and socially-practical functions. The work of applied art is distinguished by expediency and unity of forms and design. The social nature of decorative art is its collectivity; art is the heritage of many ages. It performs a series of successive layers, the most ancient of which reflect the original culture of the people deeply imprinted in its art. The works of all the genres of this art are designated by the variety of artistic traditions brought by the peoples who made up the Uzbek nation.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Uzbekistan arts and crafts\" height=\"340\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbekistan-arts-crafts.jpg\" width=\"720\" /></p>

<h2>Types of arts and crafts in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>Kinds of national arts and crafts of Uzbekistan are the original and exclusive creativity of folk artists and artisans who pass their skills from seniors to juniors. By investing a piece of the soul in each thing, they for centuries have created unique examples of products: whether it is a house utensil or a home decoration, a unique fabric for a festive dress or special utensils.</p>

<p>The creations of <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Fergana</a>, <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a>, <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a>, <a href=\"[[~339]]\" target=\"_blank\">Khiva</a> and other masters have long been famous far beyond their homeland. Their works continue to arouse interest among lovers of beauty from all over the world. Various schools of embroidered suzane and ceramics, Uzbek pictures on leather, skullcaps of various kinds and purposes, Uzbek national knives-pichoks, silk and wool carpets, souvenirs of papier-mache, wooden items, Uzbek jewelry, wonderful works from iron, which for many centuries are being created by the hands of local craftsmen and masters make up the unique exotic of Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>On the territory of Uzbekistan, the original centers and schools of folk art crafts were formed. Each terrain has its own direction. Namangan <a href=\"[[~658]]\" target=\"_blank\">Chust</a> is widely known for its skullcaps and knives; <a href=\"[[~574]]\" target=\"_blank\">Rishtan</a> is famous for cerulean ceramics; ancient <a href=\"[[~578]]\" target=\"_blank\">Margilan</a> attracts tourists with iridescent khan-atlas and sacred Bukhara is well-known for gold embroidery.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek arts and crafts\" height=\"480\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-arts-crafts.jpeg\" width=\"720\" /></p>

<h2>Past and present of Uzbekistan art and craft</h2>

<p>Decorative and applied arts of Uzbekistan developed from century to century, leaving in the inheritance unique products of famous and nameless masters, striking with richness of artistic imagination and&nbsp;consummation of forms.</p>

<p>Unique examples of folk architecture, fine and decorative arts of the Uzbeks go back to the era of primitive.</p>

<p>Closely connected with material and spiritual culture, examples of the ancestors of the Uzbeks and other Central Asian peoples, ranging from primitive painting and sculpture to art monuments of the antiquity and the Middle Ages, testify to their high endowments and rich spirituality. Having common ethnogenetic roots, these peoples for centuries have been creating in the region a variety of tools, weapons of war, richly decorated clothes and jewelry, homes and household utensils that meet their aesthetic needs. The study of ethnocultural traditions of the Central Asian ethnoses showed that they have not only a common historical destiny and common ethnographic origins. The basis for creating samples of the national culture and art of each people, including Uzbeks, was shared ground. This is evidenced by the rich monuments of the ancient era, created by ancient Khorezmians, Bactrians, Sogdians, Margilans, and subsequently Turkic-speaking ethnic groups.</p>

<p>The Uzbek folk fine and applied arts in all its forms have long attracted the attention of boffins to the profound democracy of the ideas embedded in it, reflecting the way of life, culture and worldview of the people themselves. For many centuries, the people have created unique monuments in all genres of folklore, fine and decorative art, putting in them their understanding of beauty, their desire for beauty. Developing and improving, Uzbek folk art has brought to the present day its best traditions, which could not but have a huge influence on the development of professional art. But nowadays, we are witnessing the renewal of all kinds of folk art, which today perceive ethno-cultural traditions much more widely and many times than before. At the same time, the arts and crafts of the Uzbeks, like the art of any other people, absorbed the characteristics of the culture of different epochs and various ethnic groups that have merged into the ethnogenesis of the Uzbek people, accumulating not only certain elements of other cultures, but also those or other significant events.</p>

<p>Being an integral part of folk creation, decorative and applied art of Uzbekistan, which has found its vivid expression in architecture, household utensils, clothes and ornaments, helps to reveal not only the general and particular features of life and culture, but also to determine their ethnogenetic origins.</p>

<p>Although the types of folk art that have survived to us have retained their techniques and style, they have undergone some changes in form and content. Instead of colorful images of people, animals and other creatures, scenes of separate events with the establishment of the rule of Islam, various geometric and floral ornaments appear. On ordinary household objects and ornaments, magnificent architectural structures in accordance with Muslim dogmatics, images of living beings almost completely disappear.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek arts &amp; crafts\" height=\"540\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-arts-and-crafts.jpg\" width=\"720\" /></p>

<p>Thus, in the richest ethno-cultural heritage of the Uzbek people, a special place is occupied by a multifaceted and highly decorative arts and crafts. It finds a vivid expression of artistic thought and closely interwoven with it artistic creativity, the originality of the national mentality of the Uzbeks.</p>

<p>Rapid development and constant improvement of the Uzbek national fine and applied art have found their embodiment in the world famous architectural monuments, in exquisite details of ganch, colorful tiles, rich ornamentation, carpet weaving, colorful embroideries, etc. Due to the natural talent and heroic labor of our ancestors, unique architectural monuments and fine examples of arts and crafts are a significant contribution of the Uzbek people to the world culture. Currently, traditional art is enriched with new species, forms, directions and, what is especially remarkable, with even new content.</p>

{{<p>One of the most popular types of Uzbek arts and crafts today is embroidery leather processing. So Uzbek leather tannery was before.</p>

<p>The embroidery leather processing in Uzbekistan reached a high level in the distant past, when genuine leather goods - clothes, shoes, war, hunting and horse equipment, household utensils, travel things were a daily necessity for the farmer, townspeople, warrior and nomad. Masters-tanners skillfully owned various ways of dressing good-quality skins, knew the secrets of natural vegetable tanning and staining. That is why they got elastic beautiful skins. From donkey and horse skins <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a> and <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a> masters made famous turquoise-green shagreen; thin colored saffrons were made from skins of goats and sheep; dense colored yufts were made from cattle skins; and various rawhide types of suede - from sheep\'s skins. Embossing - the most complex and effective form of decoration, is associated with morocco and yuft leather. From these kinds of leather, the most diverse assortment of art objects was produced, ranging from purses, belts to large chests, suitcases. Cold stamping of the skin was applied by masters - experts in the manufacture of suitcases and chests.</p>

<h2>Leather tanning in Uzbekistan in the old days</h2>

<p>In Uzbekistan, the processing of leather has been greatly developed. Curriers (kunchi, charmgar) were in all cities, often inhabiting entire neighborhoods or even parts of the city. They settled somewhere on the outskirts of cities, near marshes or irrigation ditches, as the water was necessary for them when processing the skins.</p>

<p>Uzbek tanners were divided into specialties. The main specialty, which gave the greatest amount of production, was the dressing of the plantar skin. The firm tops of the shoes of black color were made from the goat leather; the skin, known as Bulgory (Bulgar) - black and red was made from the cowhide. Soft white husky for various household items - sacks and purses, were made from sheep leather. Also crude, but very strong suede of yellow color, designed for the top of the shoes, worn mainly by the poor peasants, was processed. The special Uzbek branch of leather production was the dressing of shagreen leather. Such leather, painted in green, was developed from the skin with a croup of donkey and horse.</p>

<p>The skins were treated in large soluble pits of boiler-shaped form and in small tanning beds covered with boards. Clay or board vats (yoms) were used for the tanning of small batches of leather. Scrapings were cleaned with primitive tools - plows and loins from the rib of the animal. A special knife with two handles scraped hair off the hides.</p>

<p>After the annexation of Central Asia to Russia, handicraft tanneries existed along with open Russian entrepreneurs in tanneries. These factories produced predominantly bulgarian-type leather.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek pictures on leather\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-picture-on-leather.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div>

<h2>Uzbek pictures on the leather: manufacturing techniques</h2>

<p>Pictures on the leather are popular souvenirs in the production of folk crafts in Uzbekistan. Such products are made by many craftsmen in many cities of the country.</p>

<p>The quality strong leather stretches in a moistened form on a special frame. In the process of drying, the leather is squeezed a little, creating an even field for drawing. The primer is of great importance. In the manufacturing process of Uzbek pictures, the leather is impregnated with various chemicals, fats that can further affect the strength of the adhesion of the paint from the skin itself. Therefore, the primer is done carefully, in several layers and protects the paint from discoloration during the exposure to chemicals, and also avoids peeling paint.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbekistan leather processing\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbekistan-leather-processing.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<p>Painting is possible with any colors - tempera, acrylic, oil, watercolor, gouache. The main theme is historical and tourist monuments of Uzbekistan. After all, such pictures on leather are purchased during <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbek tour packages</a> either by tourists or as a gift outside the country. There are small and quite large pictures. Such large products cannot be attributed to mass products, since the whole process takes a long time.</p>

And, probably, considerable merit in this is the golden sewing, which the inhabitants of the city have long decorated their life, the brilliance and beauty of which amazed imagination.</p>

<p>In later times, historical sources testify to the high development of gold weaving in <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a> and Herat. But gradually this solar occupation was concentrated in Bukhara. Here, Uzbek gold embroidery received the right of official court art.</p>

<p>The first mention of Bukhara embroidery is found in the book of the historian of the 10th century Narshakhi \"History of Bukhara\". Unfortunately, ancient samples of embroidery have not reached our days. About it, we can judge only from museum samples not earlier than the XIX century.</p>

<p>Gold embroidery decorated ceremonial clothes, hats, shoes, accessories horse outings. It is interesting that the gold weaving craft in Uzbekistan was exclusively male. Mastery was passed from father to son.</p>

<p>In the XX century the Uzbek gold embroidery&nbsp;art spreads outside of Bukhara. Embroidery products are produced in Samarkand, Urgut, <a href=\"[[~190]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tashkent</a>, Gijduvan and other cities. The sophistication of the patterns, the subtlety of work and the fantastic craftsmanship of gold embroidery brought it world fame. Now this industry is mostly women. Like many years ago, they embroider by hand in oriental lush things. And whether it\'s a skullcap or a wall panel, shoes or a robe - everything is a true work of art.</p>

<p>Of particular interest are the Bukhara ceremonial gold embroidery gowns - zarchopon, which amaze with lush decorativeness and ornamental variety. Earlier Bukhara emirs and palace nobility used to wear such gowns. There were also so-called gift gowns, which were included in the list of embassy gifts or were presented to the subjects of the emir as a token of mercy. Today, in Uzbekistan gold embroidered man\'s gowns have become an obligatory part of the bridegroom\'s wedding dress, they are also worn in other especially solemn occasions; they are given to honorable guests.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek embroidery in gold\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-embroidery-in-gold.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div><br />

<p>The main zardozi embroidery materials with which the masters work are the metal threads kalebatun, which are a very narrow and thin strip of gilded metal or a thin silver flattened wire, sometimes covered with gilding, tightly wound on a silk or paper thread. In addition to metallic threads, colored twisted or untwisted silk is used, applications of velvet and silk, relief rosettes of a cube or a cube olmasi, made of gold threads and imitating gold ornaments.</p>

<p>Embroidery is applied to velvet dark tones of cherry, blue, purple, crimson. The soft depth of velvet enhances the decorative effect of gold embroidery. The texture of the material, the embroidery technique, the construction of the ornament, its decorative and color solution are interrelated, complement each other, create a single harmonious image.</p>

<h2>Main techniques gold weaving in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>Many generations of craftsmen have developed and perfected a peculiar technique of gold sewing. Two main methods of sewing are used: zarduzi-zaminduzi (solid) and zarduzi-gulduzi (floral).</p>

<p>When using the technique of zarduzi zaminduzi, the background is completely sewn with gilded silver, the golden thread is superimposed on the flooring from thin cords.</p>

<p>The Uzbek zarduzi-gulduzi technique was developed in the early XX century. Elements of the pattern are cut out of thick paper, cardboard, less often - leather, are superimposed on a fabric that is tightly stretched on the fingers, fixed and covered with gold or silver thread. Sketchs are created by specialists-draftsmen “tarhkash”. They draw the elements of the pattern on paper, transfer them to the cardboard with the help of pounce and cut out with special scissors. Then, elements of the composition are superimposed on the cloth and transferred to the embroiderer.</p>

<h2>Main designs of Uzbek gold embroidery</h2>

<p>There are three main types of composition in gold embroidery&nbsp;art of&nbsp;Uzbekistan. They are daukur, butador and darham.</p>

<p>In the composition of daukur the basis for decoration is ornamented with gold-embroidered border kur.</p>

<p>Butador differs by sewing the entire central field with individual bushes or other patterns at some distance from each other.</p>

<p>In the composition of darham the ornament of the central field is a continuous pattern. Its contours are trimmed with the technique of takhrir - framing with a thin cord of gold twisted threads, or kobuli (Kabul sewing) - with threads in the form of small round loops connected together.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Bukhara gold embroidery\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Bukhara-gold-embroidery.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div>

<h2>Zardozi embroidery motifs</h2>

<p>The patterns of gold embroidery products and Uzbek zardozi suites are very diverse. Vegetable forms and motifs are composed of flowers, stems, leaves, fruits - curving, swirling in a measured rhythm. Irises, carnations, tulips, delicate apple blossoms, pomegranate, cherry, almond and pepper ... All this is a stylized abundance, semantic symbolism.</p>

<p>For example, in Uzbekistan irises in ornamental zardozi motifs of embroidery symbolize peace and long life, wavy stalk of bindweed - wealth and vitality; buds and leaves express the idea of ​​fertility and the spring revival of nature. For fruitfulness \"responds\" almond-shaped motif bodom. Its more delicate and elongated forms, playing the role of a kind of amulet, are called kalampir (capsicum). Wavy and trickle patterns represent flows of life-giving water.</p>

<p>Less commonly geometric ornament in the form of circles, rhombuses, broken lines is used.</p>

<p>With a great artistic taste, calligraphic inscriptions of religious character are executed in Uzbek gold embroidery. They are placed in the rim of individual compositions.</p>

<p>Bukhara gold embroidery skullcaps are especially popular among tourists. To produce them, only smooth velvet of different colors is used (purple, green, blue, black). When embroidering, Bukhara embroiderers use mainly plant motifs: bodom (almonds), turunj (wild orange), rosettes, palmettes - and geometric motifs: circles, rhombuses and the like. There are also epigraphic inscriptions. Special delicacy of the Bukhara embroidery is given by subtle color combinations of blue, gray and crimson.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"gold embroidery in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/gold-embroidery-in-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div><br />

Uzbekistan can be called a country for adherers of lacquer miniature painting. Especially popular are jewelry boxes, powder boxes, pencil cases and cigarettes made of papier-mâché. It is known that the local school of Uzbek lacquer miniature was formed in the era of Temurids. At the end of the XIX century the secrets of its manufacture were lost, and only in the last years of the 20th century traditional artistic techniques and technologies were revived.</p>

<p>The favorite subjects of the arts-musavvirs are devoted to poetic images of Alisher Navoi and Omar Khayyam, scenes of hunting and battle based on epics \"Shahname\" and \"Baburname\", depicting folk customs and festivities, musicians and lovers. Uzbek miniature paintings cover small souvenir snuff boxes, blood vessels, chessboards, skin membranes of national timbrels – doira.</p>

<h2>History of lacquer&nbsp;painting in&nbsp;Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>The history of the art of lacquered miniature of Uzbekistan goes back. Ancient kind of national craft flourished in Bukhara and Samarkand in the epoch of Temurids. Over time, people began to forget about it, and, unfortunately, most of the works of that time have not reached us.</p>

<p>With the coming of independence in Uzbekistan, the revival of lacquer painting began.</p>

<p>Today, the school of lacquer miniature painting has established in Uzbekistan. Its bright representatives can be found in <a href=\"[[~190]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tashkent</a>, Bukhara and Samarkand. Uzbek lacquer miniature began to develop as a kind of art craft.</p>

<p>The traditional school of Uzbek lacquer miniature has its own technique and tradition of painting. The ornamental painting and painting in the style of ethnographic plots are sought-after. In recent years, floristics has developed. In the late 70\'s XX century in Uzbekistan, the revival of traditional lacquer painting on papier-mâché (\"tosh-kogoz\") began. According to medieval technology, to decorate objects with a varnish painting of gold and bronze powder, the ground was prepared with the joining of cherry or apricot glue, which was applied with brushes. Lacquer and paint for papier-mâché were made using a complex recipe. The production of papier mache and lacquer painting flourished in Samarkand in the fifteenth century, as evidenced by genuine ornamental medallions of papier-mache, truly miraculously preserved among the clays in the interior of <a href=\"[[~776]]\" target=\"_blank\">Gur Emir</a> and <a href=\"[[~775]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bibi Khanum mosque</a>. The golden blue dome in the interior of the main room of Gur Emir, consisting of 998 elements of papier-mâché, is of great interest. 112 original elements served as material for painstaking restoration work.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"lacquer painting in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/lacquer-painting-in-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div><br />

<p>There are suggestions that the art of lacquered miniature of Uzbekistan got to Northern India from Samarkand in the 15th century. In India it reached a high level of development and thrives to this day. Articles made of papier-mâché are covered with a miniature floral design. Elegant epigraphic inserts were often included in the ornamental composition of the pencil-cases. The painting was applied by thin brushes; the paintings were prepared from gold or bronze powder, from sheet gold and bronze on apricot and cherry glue. The preparation of varnishes and paints had a complex and varied recipe. Though many secrets of the Uzbek lacquer miniature were forgotten, coeval Uzbek artists and folk masters managed to revive this art by finding their own style of painting, while preserving the age-old fundamentals and forms of creating miniatures.</p>

<p>Modern lacquer painting of Uzbekistan uses the Palekh technology and eastern miniature painting. Lacquer decorates a variety of small caskets, pencil-cases for pens and pencils, tables, chess, book roots. The Uzbek miniature painting is done with natural dyes mixed with egg yolk. Today, lacquered items are traditional souvenirs, and the unusually beautiful miniature lacquer painting of modern Uzbek masters often presents the gaze of visitors to numerous exhibitions and museums in Uzbekistan and abroad.</p>

{{<h2>Carpet making in Uzbekistan: yesterday and today</h2>

<p>It is impossible to describe the Uzbek carpet in a nutshell. This is a whole artistic work, in which the multicolored nature of the ancient eastern state is imprinted: the celestial blue, forest greens, the whiteness of snowy mountain peaks and the velvet emerald shadow of the thickets on the slopes. Ruby colors of pomegranate seeds, lilac shades of grapes, golden quince are intertwined with extraordinary patterns. Bright, uncommon, intricate patterns, original color (from red-brown to red-blue), countless variations of patterns all this allowed local carpets to gain great fame in many countries.</p>

<p>Some unique samples can be seen not only in museums, but also in Uzbek houses. Perhaps, there is no such house in Uzbekistan, where there would be no carpet. By tradition, which was formed in ancient times, carpet products have always been an important part of the decoration of the home, often replacing furniture. Carpets covered the floor, decorated the walls and always appreciated not only their functional properties, but also artistic merit.</p>

<p>The art of Uzbek carpet weaving originated in ancient times, as is known from the monuments of literature and archaeological research. Uzbek carpet loom is an ancient variety of decorative art, which was praised in folklore, classical literary and historical works.</p>

<p>In the centers of carpet weaving the ancient national sketches, which traditionally carry Central Asian symbolism, carefully preserved.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek carpets\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-carpets.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div>

<h2>Uzbek carpet weaving schools</h2>

<p>Homemade carpet weaving develops in the <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Fergana Valley</a>, <a href=\"[[~2798]]\" target=\"_blank\">Nurata Mountains</a>, Kashkadarya, Surkhandarya, Syrdarya regions, <a href=\"[[~603]]\" target=\"_blank\">Karakalpakstan</a>. The Uzbek carpet weaving centers for production and marketing are also <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a>, <a href=\"[[~657]]\" target=\"_blank\">Urgut</a>, <a href=\"[[~805]]\" target=\"_blank\">Kokand</a> and Khorezm.</p>

<p>The Khiva factory is very popular for making carpets. Here the production of portrait carpets was opened, the tradition of which was known in the early Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Depending on the region, Uzbek carpets differ in color and ornament. For example, black, red and blue hues predominate in Samarkand carpets. long-bodied <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a> carpets are full of multicolored patterns. Fergana carpets have red and blue stripes. Khiva carpets are mainly made from vegetable patterns.</p>

<h2>Process of carpet making in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>Washed and fluffed up sheep or camel wool is spattered with water and spread evenly on a mat from a reed or on another, ready-made felt mat. The work piece is folded into a large roll, tied with a rope and a few women simultaneously roll it up with their feet, toss and shake up. After a while, the roll is unfolded, the damped felt is wetted with water, wound on a wooden round bar and again continues to be staggered until ready.</p>

<p>To make the yarn for the carpet the best spring wool of flat sheep was selected. Only the longest and finest fibers were used for the spinning of the filaments. Indeed, the value of the carpet has always been determined by its density. The best Uzbek carpets, woven from the finest threads, number up to several thousand knots in a square decimetre.</p>

<p>Uzbek carpet weaving process is a time-consuming, measured, laborious matter. It requires steadfastness, assiduousness, attention and at the same time speed and accuracy in the hands. An experienced skilled worker fastens the threads so fast on a base stretched over the machine, clamps the metal cord with a hook and tightly clogs it, which makes it difficult to follow the flickering of nimble hands. Since men usually do not maintain such a pace, carpet weaving is traditionally and today is a domestic women\'s occupation. Women pass their art from mother to daughter, using for this purpose their personal example. Ornaments of Uzbek silk rugs, created by craftswomen many centuries ago, once had a magical significance. They are based on stylized plant and zoomorphic motifs, magic symbols and totem signs.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"carpets of Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/carpets-in-Uzbekistan.jpeg\" width=\"600\" /></div><br />

<p>It should be noted that the old carpet masters - gilamchi painted yarn exclusively with the help of natural dyes. They knew a great many of plants from which such paints were extracted. To obtain a red color of different shades, the moraine extract was most often used. Indigo produced a range of blue flowers. Broths of bark of an oak, a nut, a pomegranate painted a yarn in brown, black and yellow tones.</p>

<p>Dense white felt mats are the most valuable, but gray and colored are also made. In Khorezm, Karakalpakstan, Surkhandarya and the Fergana Valley, polychromes are made. They are adorned with simple ornamentation.</p>

<p>It is difficult to identify when the art of carpet weaving appeared. Stone spindles in Uzbekistan were found in the excavations of semi-nomadic tribes belonging to the era of the Eneolithic. Nowadays, in some rural regions, while the process of Uzbek carpet weaving, girls use similar stone or wooden spindles.</p>

<h2>Types of carpets and rugs in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>Carpets are divided into several species along the length of the nap: long-carpet rugs \"dzhulkhirs\", short-carpet rugs \"gilams\" and lint-free carpets \"palas\".</p>

<p>Original long-sleeved carpets - dzhulkhirs with elegant joyful color today are the glory of Samarkand craftswomen. Andijan dzhulkhirs are distinguished by the fact that their central field is occupied by cruciform patterns, the motif of the wave prevails in the rim, and the color solution is built on the contrast of blue and red.</p>

<p>\"gilam\" carpets brought genuine glory to Uzbek carpets. It is difficult to determine in what era pile carpets appeared. It is known only that Marco Polo, who visited Central Asia in the 13th century, also spoke about the high quality of local products. Two centuries later, the Spanish ambassador at the court of Amir Temur, Rui Gonzalez de Clavijo, colorfully described the \"bright red carpets\" that he saw in the Samarkand palaces and gardens.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Carpets and rugs in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Carpets-and-Rugs-in-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div>

<h2>Famous silk and gold carpets in Samarkand (Uzbekistan)</h2>

<p>Silk handmade Samarkand carpets are very cuddly and incredibly pleasant to the touch. For seeming fragility, silk carpets are very sturdy and long-lived. The threads do not wipe, so the products with age acquire some nobility, gloss and a certain charm.</p>

<p>Having planned a <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">tour to Uzbekistan</a>, particularly, Samarkand, you should visit the <a href=\"[[~800]]\" target=\"_blank\">carpet factory \"Khudjum\"</a>, where this famous silk hand-made \"miracle\" has been produced. Uzbek carpet weaving girls work one or two at the machine and if one of them gets sick, the work stops completely. There is no one to replace her; the handwriting is not the same. Samarkand&nbsp;rug weavers are convinced &nbsp;that in order the carpet is beautiful and of high quality, girls should not quarrel in the process of work. And judging by the examples, the nerves in the team are fine.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek ceramics\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-ceramics.jpg\" width=\"700\" /></div><br />

<p>Slip and non-slip ceramics of the leading centers had local features, manifested in the uniqueness of forms, ornamental décor and color.

<h2>Famous ceramics schools in Uzbekistan</h2>

<h3>Ceramics of Gijduvan</h3>

<p>A characteristic feature of the Gijduvan ceramics is a solid bay of dark green or brown glaze in combination with the simplest engraved ornament. This decor is simple, but extremely original.</p>

<p>Not far from <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a> is the city of Gijduvan, which has long been recognized as the center of ceramics.</p>

<p>The guests of Gijduvan will be shown the process of birth of the bowl. And if the guests have the opportunity to stay, then they can stay there for a few days to learn all the details of pottery mastering: starting from the potter\'s wheel and finishing with painting and roasting. All your own masterpieces can be taken with you.</p>

<p>The distinctive features of the Gijduvan ceramics, which have come down to us from the depths of centuries, is a special vegetable border - \"islimi\", which adorns the central part of the rim of the bowl. The upper part of the rim is like compressed crosses. The bottom of the bowl is decorated with engraving - \"khona khorosh.\"</p>

<p>The other very characteristic pattern is the painting \"abr\". \"Abr\" means the cloud.</p>

<p>Another feature of the Gijduvan ceramics is the paints \"angob\". These are paints, the basis of which, in addition to the coloring matter is clay. These thick paints-clays are applied over the raw product and when fired they give the effect of a convex, very relief pattern. It turns out that the convex pattern is in the vitreous thickness of the yellowish glaze, and when the light hits the surface of the dishes, the effect of the glow of the pattern is created. Most masters of Gijduvan produce paints from natural components.</p>

<p>The Gijduvan ceramics was presented by Uzbek masters, in particular, by the House of Ceramics of Nazrullayevs at numerous competitions and festivals, where it received the highest marks.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek Gijduvan ceramics\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-Gijduvan-ceramics.jpg\" width=\"700\" /></div>

<h3>Rishtan ceramics</h3>

<p>Rishtan potters enjoy great fame. They combine turquoise glaze with a white background coating and vice versa. In the technique of these masters, geometric ornamentation is not used. In Rishtan, the oldest masters and representatives of the younger generation brilliantly master both the molding technique and the painting.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of the Rishtan ceramics is bi-hromic coloring. It is as restored, as is the secret of the production of the famous glaze “ishkori”, a dye derived from plant ash. Currently, masters are working with uncomplicated ready-made alkaline glazes. The decor of the Rishtan ceramics is mainly vegetative, as well as images of kumgans, symbols of prosperity and well-being, knives, birds, fish, elements of architectural decor.</p>

<p>The closest in terms of color to the Rishtan ceramics is the Khorezm one. On the dishes is the same style of painting as in the architectural decor.</p>

<p>Khorezm painting cannot be confused with anything. It has an amazing beauty and elegance ornate pattern with wide horizontal patterned edges. There are the same, traditional for the Asian Middle Ages, the blue tones. Beautiful, dense, clinking clay is a distinctive feature of the Khorezm ceramics. Smooth, large planes of the lyagans with raised boards are also distinctive features of the Khorezm ceramics.</p>

<p>The masters of the Samarkand school revive the traditions of decorating vessels with stucco elements in the form of heads of animals and birds.</p>

<p>The ceramics of Shakhrisabz is unusually warm and sunny. It is characterized by large decorative patterns, located in a free rhythm, creating picturesque spots.</p>

<p>In Tashkent ceramics there is so much mixed that it is difficult to single out a unifying factor. In the ceramic patterns of Tashkent products one can see pre-Islamic drawings and Arabic ligature, Hellenic motifs, Chinese symbols and even Russian patterns.</p>

<p>A wonderful hereditary master A. Rakhimov, the son of ceramist and researcher of ceramics of Uzbekistan M. Rakhimov, works in Tashkent. He creates dishes in the style of Temurid, Kashgar, black Samarkand ceramics. His works reflect the rich technological artistic experience of folk artists practically in all regions of the republic. The tradition of making a clay toy is also returning. This kind of craft, characteristic in the past for the Bukhara-Samarkand ceramics school, has practically disappeared.</p>

<h2>Uzbek ceramics in the old days</h2>

<p>Archaeological excavations testify to the great development of ceramic production in Uzbekistan. This production was also developed at the end of the 19th century.</p>

<p>Pottery items were produced in all cities and many villages.</p>

<p>Along with the ornamented and covered with polished exquisite dishes in everyday life, simple, rough non-pourable dishes were widely used. Jugs of various shapes and large earthenware pots for water, various dishes and cups, basins for washing clothes and other necessities were produced in all districts, towns and villages, as the demand for them was very high. A special mention should be made of water pipes (tsuvur) and special pitchers (digir) for water-lifting facilities. The production of digirs was developed in Khorezm. A special branch of pottery was the production of tandirs (clay ovens) - special ovens for baking bread, which looked like a large pot without a bottom. They were molded manually from clay with a wool impurity and dried without roasting.</p>

<p>The rest of the dishes were molded on a pottery machine (charch). It consisted of two wooden circles, mounted on one axis, reinforced vertically. The master was sitting in front of the machine, rotating with his feet the lower circle. The upper circle with clay lying on it came into motion. The master very dexterously gave it the desired shape.</p>

<p>After the end of the molding, the vessel was cut from the machine, dried well, then the pattern and glaze were applied, and then it was burned in a special pottery furnace (khumdon).</p>

<p>Glazed dishes were made from good, specially worked clay, sometimes from a mixture of different varieties of it.</p>

<p>The special branch of Uzbek ceramic production was the production of burnt bricks. Front brick at that time, almost was not produced. It was manufactured only in individual cases and in a small number.</p>

{{<p>Uzbek chasing is one of the most ancient types of applied art in our country. Embossing on metal is a creating of carved ornaments for the decoration of handmade items mainly from copper and brass. It is one of the most common types of handcrafted work of Uzbek ethnic art in terms of artistic design, that is why <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">traveling around Uzbekistan</a>, you are lucky enough to find many items decorated with embossing in all diversity of local folk motifs.</p>

<p>Embossing in Uzbekistan is a noble profession. Chaser compared to a simple tinsmith is like a carpenter-cabinetmaker in comparison with a carpenter. The chaser, in order to make a pitcher-oftoba, must own the craft of a foundry, blacksmith, chaser and engraver for metal, a carver and a tinker.</p>

<p>Uzbek copper-chased products have long been popular with the local population. Except to the utilitarian value, their decorative qualities were appreciated. The chased copper dishes were exhibited on the shelves of open built-in closets as part of the decorative decoration of the dwelling.</p>

<h2>History of the Uzbek chasing</h2>

<p>The first chased items found in contemporary Uzbekistan are dated to the 4<sup>th</sup> millennium BC. A small number of samples were found during archaeological excavations. These were the simplest knives and jewelry. Much later, in the XV century, this art reached the high level. The spectrum of chased items has significantly expanded. The masters began to make jugs, plates, bowls, trays, caskets, smoking appliances. All of them were not only used for their intended purpose. Their unique decor adorned the dwellings of the nobility, being a symbol of prosperity and luxury.</p>

<p>The flourishing of the art of chasing is considered to be the period of the 18th-19th centuries. Products, dated to these centuries, today are a treasury of historical and ethnographic museums of Uzbekistan and other countries. Most of them are now in the museums of Uzbekistan and abroad.</p>

<p>The tools of the Uzbek masters for chasing are quite simple and almost do not differ from those used by artisans in the Middle Ages. With the help of simple and not sophisticated tools, the tinsmith makes artistic products, giving them bizarre shapes, decorating them with subtle patterns. From ancient times they have survived to our days almost without change. These are incisors of different widths, a small hammer with a slightly curved and thickened at the end handle, metal compasses.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"chasing in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/chasing-in-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div>

<h2>Uzbek school of embossing</h2>

<p>For a long period of existence in the art of embossing, local styles, characterized by unique forms of products, as well as technical and artistic techniques, developed. Uzbek embossing represents various methods of engraving. Deeper engraving is called “kandakori”, less deep - pure engraving is called “chizma”. Except for engraving by Uzbek masters, slotted chasing “shabaka” is used.</p>

<p>The most famous were the products of the <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a> and <a href=\"[[~339]]\" target=\"_blank\">Khiva</a> chasers, distinguished by the beauty and plasticity of the form, the severity and perfection of the motifs of the ornament, the depth of the chisel.</p>

<p>Bukhara embossing on copper with ceramics is one of the well-known kinds of folk art for us and abroad.</p>

<p>The Bukhara school of copper-chased articles, in contrast to the <a href=\"[[~805]]\" target=\"_blank\">Kokand</a>, <a href=\"[[~190]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tashkent</a>, Khorezm and Karshi, is distinguished by modesty and rigour of forms. A relatively free background is processed with a stroke or dots. Smooth wide contour lines - strips (called kundal) give Bukhara ornament the particularly expressive.</p>

<p>Plastically clear floral ornament (islimi) is very elegant and beautiful. Sometimes Bukhara masters decorated their products with calligraphic inscriptions, stylizing them under plant patterns. In rare cases, the background was tinctured in different colors. It was always done with great taste.</p>

<p>Bukhara embossing is a subtle and painstaking art. It is performed with the help of such tools as a steel pencil (pulat kalam) and a mallet.</p>

<p>Khiva tinmen make water vessels with flattened sides, sometimes ribbed. The relief of chasing is much deeper than in other areas, the background is sometimes coloured with black lacquer. In addition to vegetable ornament islimi in the form of shoots dotted with flower heads, the Khiva chased items are adorned with characteristic patterns in the form of medallions on the background of a grid of complex configuration that gives the items a special color.</p>

<p style=\"margin-left:3.4pt;\">A variety of shapes and carved decorations is characteristic for chased items from Karshi and <a href=\"[[~509]]\" target=\"_blank\">Shakhrisabz</a>. Masters have developed a peculiar design of the lid in the form of a box of cotton to a bowl for washing. Its petals open when carrying the product. In the design of chased dishes, Shakhrisabz masters use overhead plates and stamped parts, medallions with inserts of turquoise and colored glass, also use a color tint of the background and surface.</p>

<p style=\"margin-left:3.4pt;\"><a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a> embossing kept artistic traditions of the last centuries. The uncommon form of Samarkand tea dishes is rare among products from other regions of Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>One of the oldest centers of Uzbek embossing is in the <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Fergana Valley</a>. The masters make vessels for water and for tea, using the favorite motif of the almond-shaped pattern \"kalampir\". Only in Fergana traditional copper lamps and candlesticks are made. Among the jugs from Kokand there are tall slender vessels “oftoba urdak” of pretentious shape in the form of a duck. Vegetable Kokand ornament is shallow, but clear and densely sated with small details creating bizarre patterns. Products are finished with a punch, a stroke, various kinds of meshes and figured notches, decorated with turquoise, garnets and corals. The Kokand masters were the first in Uzbekistan who began to mint architectural motifs on the trays, in particular, the palace of Khudoyarkhan and fantastic animals.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the traditional Tashkent chasing for metal is similar in form and ornamentation to the Kokand one. The geometric motifs resemble carved wood ornaments, in particular the “pargori” style. Some elements of the patterns of Tashkent embossing were rare in other regions.</p>

<h2>The process of Uzbek embossing</h2>

<p>The work of the chaser begins with the moment when he throws a composition on the paper, which is then transferred to the tracing paper. With the help of a needle along the contour of the whole pattern holes are pierced. Through them graphite is poured, creating a contour of the pattern on the vessel. Then, using the chisel, a picture is drawn. Then the product is polished by hand or on a machine. If the metal is yellow, then it shines like the sun, if - red, it burns like fire.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the popularity of chased items in Uzbekistan has not lost its relevance in our days, because you can find a product for every taste and color, whether it\'s a jug or a vessel for wine, or a dish. Arriving in Uzbekistan, get a masterpiece of Uzbek chasing.</p>

{{<p>Pichok or pchak - the Uzbek national handmade knife - from time immemorial meant more than just a tool or a combat weapon. This is the attribute of the male costume, a powerful amulet, and participant in many rites and sacraments. That\'s why the great skill of creating singing, richly decorated blades has been preserved on the territory of Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>A distinctive feature of the Uzbek knives is the brand (tamga). As a rule, the main elements in the tamga are the crescent moon - the symbol of faith, the stars and the symbol of cotton. Previously, it was believed that the number of stars in the mark indicated the number of children of the master or his students. In our time, the stars are, more likely, a tribute to tradition. On modern blades in the mark you can find a stylistic image of anything, everything that is dear to the master.</p>

<h2>Types of Uzbek knives</h2>

<p>There are many species of Uzbek pichoks. They are classified according to their purpose, on the shape of the blade, the type of handle, the size, thickness, and even the decor. The most popular knives are the osh-pichoks (table knives) and the kassob-pichoks (meat knives). Both types of pichoks have a characteristic wide blade with a slightly curved or straight tip. Blade with a curved end is called kayik, which means \"boat\". A blade with an even edge is called tugri-pichok, in translation - a \"straight knife\". Osh-pichoks are made of two different sizes, corresponding to our modern concepts of medium and small kitchen knife.</p>

<p>Kasob-pichok in form differs little from osh-pichok, but its magnitude is shocking even the imaginary of experts of cold weapons. Such an Uzbek knife, massive, with a thick boot and a large handle, easily cuts almost everything.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"knives of Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/knives-of-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></div><br />

<p>For a gift or a collection, arapcha-pichok (literally \"Arabic knife\") is most suitable. It is light and inexpressibly elegant. It has a thin curved blade to the edge and a marvelous beauty hilt of bone or horn. In the distant past, the arapcha-pichok was a formidable weapon. Today, having lost its military mission, in Uzbekistan this knife became a welcome masculine gift, adornment and amulet.</p>

<p>A lot of popular old types of knives still come from the anvils of Uzbek pichokchi (a master who creates knives). Here is the Chust-pichok - a wide, large knife, which the tip of the blade is boldly bent upward, and the large cone-shaped handle is inclined downwards; the bola-pichok (children\'s knife) - a tiny knife, a traditional gift for a little boy; the threatening twisted Afgani-pichok (Afghan knife) and a powerful, with a deep notch in the upper part of the blade, the Kazakh-pichok. There are dozens and dozens of species.</p>

<p>The first mention of the pichok dates back to the 14th-15th century. It was then that Uzbek knives began their journey around the world first as a curiosity, and later as a universal household tool. The production of blades of this Uzbek knife is mainly made of carbon steel. In the old days, iron from India or broken weapons was used. Later, in the XX century, in the course went valves, springs from cars and other parts. Currently, the pichoks are forged from high-carbon tool steels or steels for making ball bearings.</p>

<h2>Metal and features of sharpening</h2>

<p>Uzbek masters-pichokchi use for the creation of knives two types of metal, conventionally called \"spring steel\" and \"bearing steel\". The first one is rigid, ringing, sparkling. The second one is flexible, singing, matte. It should be understood that both are not \"stainless steel\", therefore, they are prone to corrosion.</p>

<p>So why to buy knives that rust? Well, firstly, we noted that the Uzbek pchak is much more than just a knife. And secondly, the Uzbek knives have the highest coefficient of sharpening. This means that it is impossible to pinch any stainless steel to the sharpness that pichok gives.</p>

<p>That is why the experts of Uzbek knives never sharpen them. They only dress them. Before each use of a knife a man should make 8-10 movements on a special river stone or on the bottom of a porcelain bowl. And the knife restores the highest sharpness.</p>

<h2>Refer to the Uzbek pichok with a piety</h2>

<p>The Uzbek handmade pichok requires special handling rules. To prevent the formation of rust, it should be kept dry and stored in vertical wooden stands. An important condition for the knife\'s life is its constant work. The more you use pichok, the longer it will keep its appearance. One should rub the knife with fat or oil.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek pichoks\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-pichoks.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></div>

<h2>How to choose?</h2>

<p>If you are ready to use an Uzbek knife at home, then you should choose the osh-pichok. Choosing from a dozen of the same knives, take each one in the hand. A knife that best fits your needs will certainly resonate with the heat of the handle. It will be very warm in a moment. There is no mysticism here. Just the handle is very tightly laid into your hand. Such a close contact will ensure you comfortable work with the Uzbek knife.</p>

<p>If you take a knife for a gift, then give preference to the Arabic-pichok. It is marvelously elegant and beautiful. At the same time it is very functional.</p>

<p>In case you need a knife for hiking, fishing or hunting, pay attention to thick penknives, such as Kazakh-pichok, Chust-pichok or pichoks with a blade of \"tolbargi\" (willow leaf).</p>

<p>There are many counters with Uzbek handmade knives at any large bazaar of, visited by tourists during <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbekistan tour packages</a>. There are a lot of excellent pichoks on these sparkling trays. But the optimal option for buying are numerous exhibitions of artisans, which today are held throughout Uzbekistan. Here is a rich choice, good prices, and the master, selling you a knife, is interested in that you are not disappointed in the purchase.</p>

<p>Today in Uzbekistan hundreds of masters of national handmade knives are working. The craft is still respected, and the products are popular. The master of Shakhrikhan, <a href=\"[[~587]]\" target=\"_blank\">Andijan</a>, <a href=\"[[~658]]\" target=\"_blank\">Chust</a>, <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a>, <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a> and <a href=\"[[~190]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tashkent</a> are especially famous for their pichoks.

{{<p>Silkworm&nbsp;breeding in Uzbekistan has long been considered a traditional folk craft. In many cities and villages of Uzbekistan silkworms were grown and a variety of silk and semi-silk fabrics of simple and complex interweaving were produced. Uzbek ornamental wealth is famous for Uzbek national fabrics - striped \"bekasabs\" for men\'s clothing and \"khan-atlas\" for women.</p>

<p>Khan-atlas is the pearl of Uzbekistan. In this beautiful fabric, the character and traditions of the Uzbek people are displayed. Uzbek&nbsp;silk fabric&nbsp;khan-atlas has a unique bright color palette, a polish structure, symbolizing kindness, optimism and indomitable energy.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek khan atlas\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-khan-atlas.jpeg\" width=\"800\" /></div>

<h2>Legend of khan-atlas</h2>

<p>A lot of legends tell about the history of the appearance of Uzbek khan-atlas. In one old history it is said about the rich ruler of the city of <a href=\"[[~578]]\" target=\"_blank\">Margilan</a> and the poor weaver. The artificer-weaver had a beautiful young daughter, in whom the old khan fell in love. He wanted to fill up his harem with another gorgeous girl, making the daughter of the weaver his fifth wife. The girl\'s father, having learned about the desire of the ruler, begged him to change his mind and leave his daughter alone. Khan was a stubborn person and did not want to abandon the young girl, but after persuasion the khan agreed not to marry in exchange for a condition. The old man must bring something capable of eclipsing the beauty of his daughter.</p>

<p>The weaver was grieving, not knowing how to surprise the khan and save his girl from an unwanted wedding. Not having slept all night and having lost almost all hope, he went at dawn to the irrigation ditch. The sun rose - the old man bowed his head and looked at the water. He saw a surprisingly beautiful reflection of the blue of the sky, the clouds shimmering with a multitude of flowers, the gentle green of the trees. After that, the weaver returned to the workshop and created an unusually soft and light fabric, like a whiff of a cold breeze, rich in bright colors, like a rainbow in the sky. It was Uzbek khan atlas. The khan was struck by the fantastic creation of the weaver, and he fulfilled his promise. He canceled the wedding. This unusually beautiful fabric began to bear the name of the khan-atlas, which means \"fabric created for the ruler.\"</p>

<p>Margilan khan-atlas always stood out for its uniqueness of ornaments. Rainbow silk was very complex in manufacturing and therefore it was very expensive. He could replace money in trade transactions, it was inherited as a family heirloom, it was gifted. Silk production in&nbsp;Uzbekistan originated many centuries ago. <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a> became its center, eventually moved to the city of Margilan, where it glorified the <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Ferghana Valley</a>. The colorful cloth was sent along the <a href=\"[[~26]]\" target=\"_blank\">Great Silk Road</a> to Egypt, Baghdad, Kashgar and Greece.</p>

<h2>Manual production of Uzbek khan atlas</h2>

<p>The manual work on the manufacture of Uzbek khan atlas&nbsp;fabric is very laborious and extraordinarily complex. Initially, it is necessary to extract the finest filaments from the cocoon of the silkworm. Then one needs to apply the pattern by dyeing the strands. Only vegetable ingredients were used for staining. For example, to get a blue color, indigo was used; to get a red colour madder is used; and for yellow isparak is used. Other natural dyes were also used, which gave the threads a rich persistent color. A vague pattern called “abr” (cloud) was obtained due to a special technology, according to which the filaments were stained before weaving. The way of production by special ligation of threads before painting was called ikat. After all, the Uzbek silk ikat fabric had a unique pattern with indistinct edges.</p>

<p>Uzbek khan-atlas was very expensive and was affordable only for wealthy people, but over time it became more accessible and almost every girl could wear clothes from this silk. At the present time this hand-crafted art began to recede into the background and the fabric was made in weaving factories by applying paint to the already woven fabric.</p>

<p>In the modern world, Uzbek silk fabric gradually began to lose its popularity, as the girls stopped adhering to traditions and wearing national dresses. But this beautiful fabric has got a new life and it was started to use by fashion designers, creating exclusive models of clothes. Products from the Uzbek khan-atlas glitter on the world\'s catwalks in the collections of famous designers and amaze the audience with their magnificence and originality.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Margilan khan atlas\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Margilan-khan-atlas.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<p>In Uzbek silk fabric, first of all, the beauty of color combinations attracts. Masters bring and perfection coloring of national fabrics, starting from the surrounding phenomena of nature, flora and fauna. In the ornamentation of Uzbek fabrics, it sounds like gold of sand, greens of valleys, blue lakes, southern sunsets, flowering of orchards. Unique, original, picturesque coloring national fabrics harmoniously combine and look nice.</p>

<h2>Silkworm&nbsp;breeding and silk weaving in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>Although the production of silk fibre and the creation of clothes today are mostly automated, almost all the silkworm breeding in Uzbekistan is bred on private and individual farms, where cocoons are bred as many centuries ago.</p>

<p>In late April - early May, from the special stock of the previous agricultural year, the Uzbek government distributes 20 grams of silkworm eggs to each farmer who is going to cultivate them. Farmers are preparing places equipped with large boxes that have a special flooring. The only food for the silkworm are mulberry leaves, cut into small pieces. Cropped mulberry crowns restore their branches to the next year. Initially, 20 grams of silkworm occupy an area of ​​1 square meter and consume up to 3 kg of leaves daily. But over time they begin to absorb more and more food.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek silk khan-atlas\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-silk-khan-atlas.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<p>By the end of the first month, each mulberry silkworm, which has been so microscopic at first, grows the size of a little finger. The entire stock of silkworms occupies 2-3 meters and consumes up to 300 kilograms of leaves every day! Then the silkworm stops eating, and approximately a week winds silk fiber around it in a cocoon. Some silkworms are called \"original\", they are separated to be preserved for several months, during which they lay eggs. The rest are killed in the cocoons by steam. Otherwise they will go out and spin the silk fiber. Then each cocoon is evaporated and carefully untwisted. Conventional 4-centimeter cocoons give from 800 to 1200 meters of fiber yarn. Uzbek silk fabric for making clothes is woven from several threads of coiled fiber. In general, Uzbekistan produces about 30,000 tons of cocoons a year.</p>

<p>As well as many centuries ago, today the fabric of the khan-atlas is a brand of Uzbekistan. The fabric with iridescent inimitable ornament continues to reign among other types of fabrics and pleases its owners with unusual brightness, beauty and tenderness.</p>

{{<p>Interior design in Uzbekistan, tired of the newfangled western ergonomic and high-tech solutions in recent years, is increasingly turning to national aesthetics, Eastern symbolism and even mysticism. One of such trends, surreptitiously captivating interiors of offices and houses is the use of Uzbek national dolls. More and more collectors, owners of private galleries and collections, artisans are drawn in this business with a huge passion.</p>

<p>Masters have something to show in miniature figures: a rich variety of national clothes, art school fashions, coloring and texture of fabrics, as well as the work of jewelers.<br />
<br />
The traditional Uzbek dolls are based on straw, cane, ceramics and wood. These items are what the base or body of a toy is usually made from. The doll is dressed in national clothes, decorated with embroidery, beads and lace.</p>

<p>Until now, different types of Uzbek dolls have come up; they are glove and puppet dolls. They are made of embellished papier-mache, wood, clay. Clothes for dolls are made of fabrics in the national style. Each master has its own traditional technology of designing clothes and embroidery.<br />
<br />

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek national dolls\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-national-dolls.jpg\" width=\"740\" /></div>

<h2>The history of the appearance of Uzbek dolls</h2>

<p>It is said that puppets on the territory of contemporary Uzbekistan appeared during the campaigns of Macedonian to Central Asia. They were brought here by the ancient Greeks. But they were not widespread and were forgotten. For a long time, the dolls were not made for religious reasons, since it was forbidden to depict a human face.</p>

<p>A large number of street puppeteers, who entertained the inhabitants, appeared in the era of the Temurids. Hence the origin of the puppet art of Uzbekistan is.</p>

<p>The mastery of making Uzbek national dolls was practically lost in the XIX-XX centuries, but in the last 20 years the revival of this uncommon craft began.</p>

<h2>The creation of the Uzbek folk dolls</h2>

<p>Making a doll is a creative and often unpredictable process. It does not fit any clearly delineated time frame. The image of a doll can last for months. When the image is found, its incarnation begins. The process of creating the head, hands and feet of the doll takes several stages. A few days before the work begins, clay is soaked and exposed. And only then the creation of forms from clay of different consistency begins. Liquid clay is used to fill molds, more elastic one - to correct facial features and shape details. The doll dries up, and then it is polished and fired in the oven. Cooled forms are set on the frame. This takes another day. Then sewing of clothes begins, but here are nuances, especially if it is a thoughtful original image. The search of the right fabric and accessories is led. So the creation of one Uzbek doll can take from two weeks to three months.</p>

<p>In Uzbekistan, tourists can not only buy original hand-made Uzbek dolls - souvenirs directly in the workshop of puppet-makers, but also see and even participate in their making while <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">traveling around cities of Uzbekistan</a>.</p>

{{<p>According to historical handbooks, the most ancient toy, preserved to this day is ceramic one. In this regard, the Uzbek national painted toy-whistles \"khushtak\" became very famous. \"Hushtak\" is an Uzbek clay toy - a whistle of very weak firing.</p>

<p>In olden times Uzbek toy hushtak was made for everyone individually, as it was a mascot. Our ancestors believed in its magical ability to guard against dark forces, protect from evil eye and disease. The whistling, for example, caused \"water of mercy\" - a spring rain – “obi rahmat”. It could cause the wind, scare away the evil spirit. Most often Uzbek national&nbsp;toys&nbsp;khushtaks were given a fairy-zoomorphic image in the form of lambs, horses, dogs, elephants, birds, as well as fantastic animals - dragons and animals unknown to nature, saddled with a rider.</p>

<p>The origins of the form of clay toys khushtaks go far into the period of Zoroastrism in the territory of Central Asia. Since ancient times Uzbek hushtak had a sacred meaning in itself; and served as a talisman.</p>

<p>It is curious that even with the advent of Islam, Uzbek toy khushtak continued to fulfill its role as a pre-Islamic cult. The production of these Uzbek clay toys, as a rule, was timed to coincide with the holiday of the spring equinox of Navruz - the beginning of agricultural work. &nbsp;Hopes for a harvest, for a life without troubles in the next year were associated with khushtaks. Uzbek clay toys hushtaks were made and handed out to children, so that, running around with toys through fields and gardens, they whistled off evil spirits and called for abundant rains.</p>

<p>This particular pottery fishery has come down to our days. The secrets of molding and baking were passed on to the families from generation to generation. Today, clay toys in Uzbekistan are fired, as in the old days, in special constructions of round and oval shape, similar to tandyrs (Uzbek traditional ovens). The products are specially laid with \"kalanchiks\" - fragments of broken utensils, to keep the identical temperature when firing.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek toys khushtaks\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-khushtaks.JPG\" width=\"600\" /></div><br />

<p>Nowadays, such Uzbek traditional toys are being made in the vicinity of ancient <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a>.</p>

<p>Kubaro Babaeva, known as Kubaro opa from the Bukhara region, the village of Uba is a hereditary toy-maker. The village of Uba is considered an ancient ceramic center. Kubaro opa is a follower of the famous craftswoman from Uba, Khamro Rakhimova. Khamro Rakhimova is the most famous craftswoman of the last century. Khamro Rakhimova lived all her life in the village of Uba, not far from <a href=\"[[~602]]\" target=\"_blank\">Gijduvan</a>, Bukhara region. And in due time, in the sixties she shocked archaeologists. Few people suspected which ancient skill Khamro Rakhimov kept. During the excavations in <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a> (Uzbekistan) clay toys were discovered, the age of which was more than a millennium. And what was the astonishment of archaeologists when they compared the toys of Khamro Rakhimova with those found in excavations. They were practically indistinguishable. Uzbek traditional toys from the village of Uba are very canonic: in shape, in elements, in details, in clay and paints. These are most often animal figurines. Each of the figures can carry other figures.</p>

<p>Also, the real brand of Uzbekistan are ceramic \"babaychiki\" - lovely, brightly painted figures of funny people in Uzbek national costumes. Each figure is a work of art and unlike each other. Here is an old aksakal (alderman) with a bright yellow Uzbek cake in his hands; another mustachioed little man carries a watermelon and a melon from the market; a tea-man is next to a teapot or a shish kebab or a plate with pilaf; and here is an old man on a merry donkey. But all of them are united by merry and kind faces. These figures are made in different sizes - from a matchbox, similar to Japanese netsuke, to huge, in the growth of a person. And in both cases, all the features of the costume and objects are depicted in detail.</p>

<p>The Uzbek clay toy is a small, inexpensive, but an excellent souvenir and a gift for the memory of <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbekistan tour package</a>.</p>

{{<p>Among the remarkable traditions with which Uzbek art is rich, a special place is occupied by the artistic design of fabrics. This branch of traditional art originated in antiquity and already in the period of antiquity and the early Middle Ages acquired a developed character.</p>

<p>Uzbek suzanne today is a visiting card of our republic. After all, as soon as the conversation begins about suzane and embroidery, everyone immediately says - Uzbekistan! And it is possible.</p>

<p>Uzbekistan is famous for its suzani: decorative silk embroideries, striking imagination with bright colors and a variety of exquisite patterns.</p>

<p>Suzanne or suzani (from Persian - \"sewn with a needle\") – a &nbsp;decorative panel, embroidered with silk or cotton threads.</p>

<p>It is believed that Uzbek needlework originated in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, but some experts believe that it was invented before the 18th century.</p>

<p>In the 15th century, the ambassador of Castile, Rui de Clavijo Gonzalez, who visited Tamerlane, compiled detailed descriptions of the embroideries, which were probably the predecessors of Uzbek suzani.</p>

<p>Uzbek suzani textiles traditionally were made by brides as part of their dowry. By tradition, Uzbek suzani pillows, bedspread, rugs and wall hangings are created by women\'s hands. The methods of sewing and the ornament of embroidery were transferred from mother to daughter. In each family the decorative embroidery was created. The execution of suzani, as a rule, took one or two years of effort of the skilled workers. Dowry for the girls was prepared when they were still young. Mother and her relatives embroidered beautiful clothes for the bride. Since ancient times, Uzbekistan suzani embroidery has always been present in every house. They decorated the walls, and served as an amulet.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek suzani\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-suzani.jpeg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<p>Today in Uzbekistan, as before, suzani is embroidered, but not only by brides, but also many female and male masters.</p>

<p>Popular Uzbek suzani motifs are sun and moon, flowers (especially tulips, carnations, irises), leaves, vines, fruits (especially garnets), sometimes - fish and poultry. When creating syuzane, various techniques of needle embroidery and crochet embroidery are used.</p>

<p>There are various Uzbek suzani schools: <a href=\"[[~503]]\" target=\"_blank\">Nurata</a>, <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a>, <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a>, <a href=\"[[~657]]\" target=\"_blank\">Urgut</a>, <a href=\"[[~509]]\" target=\"_blank\">Shakhrisabz</a>, <a href=\"[[~190]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tashkent</a> and <a href=\"[[~585]]\" target=\"_blank\">Fergana</a>. Each of the schools is distinguished for its sewing features and original colors.</p>

<p>Infinite love of nature is reflected in the expression in embroideries of Bukhara\'s seamstresses. Bukhara suzane of the XIX century differs in the richness of floral motifs that convey the unaffected beauty of the surrounding nature. They are images of trees, flowering bushes, various colors: carnations, tulips, peonies, chrysanthemums, etc.</p>

<p>The most common in Nurata is a composition with an eight-pointed star in the center and four large bouquets in the corners. Another type of ornamentation is a rhomboid mesh formed by jagged leaves. Its cells are filled with branches with flowers, rosettes, figures of birds and animals. There are Uzbek embroideries, in which individual suzani floral motifs are staggered against the background of the fabric. The combination of tones in individual motifs is distinguished by great refinement: in one flower petals are yellow and golden, in the other - blue, pink and cream. On a branch near the light-turquoise leaves blue flowers grow. The art of Nurata embroidery was practically lost by the middle of the 20th century, and only nowadays masters have revived the traditions of their ancestors.</p>

<p>Samarkand needlework (Uzbekistan) originates from the art of ancient Sogdiana. Samarkand products have larger and laconic details of the figure. In this case, the clarity of the patterns is important. The main motif is a round rosette of crimson tones, surrounded by a deciduous ring.</p>

<p>An unforgettable impression is made by embroidery from the ancient city of Urgut. This is the Uzbek suzani fabric, embroidered with seam \"Bosma\" on white cotton cloth, less often on raspberry or yellow silk. Blue, yellow stylized patterns in the form of flowers symbolize the sun. Sometimes in the ornaments of Uzbek suzani there are motifs of various household items, like teapots and bowls. Volumetric, dense embroidery on suzane from Urgut almost entirely covers the surface of the product.</p>

<p>A large medallion is often placed on the Shakhrisabz articles, and in the corners there are quarters of the same medallions. Medallions have a geometric ornament and a rich multicolor coloring. The Uzbek handmade embroidered suzani textiles in Shakhrisabz, executed on a colored background by a tambour seam are interesting and expressive.</p>

<p>The needlework of Tashkent masters is distinguished by a very peculiar style. Here are two types of embroideries - palyak and gulkurpa.</p>

<p>The products of the Fergana school are usually executed on dark green or purple silk or satin and are distinguished by a light pattern.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek suzani fabric\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek suzani fabric.jpeg\" width=\"800\" /></div>

<h2>One of the ways to create the Uzbek suzani product:</h2>

<p>1. On order for the master homespun unpainted silk and silk threads of a certain torsion and a certain thickness (this is an important point on which depends how to lay the thread in the process of embroidery) are made.</p>

<p>The thread for the fabric and for embroidery is made completely by hand - from uncoiling the silk cocoons to twisting into the finished thread.</p>

<p>2. Having a design by color, the master himself colors the fabric and threads in the necessary colors.</p>

<p>For the dyeing of the cloth, the pomegranate peel is most often used. Its coloring gives the silk shades from light beige to burgundy, as well as a certain gloss and softness to the material itself. Also the master uses mineral dyes, mainly for bright orange, pink colors.</p>

<p>The thread is also colored with both natural and mineral dyes. The most laborious process of dyeing the yarn is the melange technique (a smooth transition from light to dark shade), but the flowers in patterns embroidered with a melange thread look very gentle, like the living ones.</p>

<p>3. Having applied a pattern to the finished fabric, the master begin to embroider.</p>

<p>For example, embroidery of pillow cases takes from 3 to 5 days, depending on the urgency of the work.</p>

<p>The embroideress works sitting (most often on the kurpachea - an Uzbek mattress that lies on the floor) above the wooden frame on the low legs, on which the fabric with the motif of embroidery is stretched.</p>

<p>4. When the Uzbek handmade embroidery suzani textile is ready, the master gives it to the seamstress, who, depending on the purpose of the product (pillowcase, panel, jacket, carpet), cuts the necessary details and, with her sewing skill shapes the new creation.</p>

<p>5. To ensure that the finished product does not shed during use and washing in the future, the master treats it with an infusion of pomegranate peel (the infusion is on the water). It fixes the color of the threads, and also gives shine and softness to the very embroidery on the product.</p>

<p>Hand embroidery is a whole branch on the tree of Uzbek folk art. Ancient mythological symbols of suzane ornaments, the boundless imagination of the craftsmen and the warmth of their hands, carefully creating this masterpiece, is not only the continuity of the old traditions. This is the very poetic, subtle and sincere soul of the Uzbek people.</p>

<p>Uzbek suzani products for sale can become an excellent and useful souvenir in the house that will remind you of an unforgettable <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">trip to sunny and hospitable Uzbekistan</a>.</p>

{{<h2>Uzbekistan wood carving is the art, which survived the centuries</h2>

<p><a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">Traveling around Uzbekistan</a>, it is hardly possible to see a traditional Uzbek house, where there were no wooden ornaments. Since ancient times, local masters loved and valued the tree and artfully shaped it with carvings.</p>

<p>Wood carving in Uzbekistan arose as decorations of wooden columns, which were greatly used in the ancient architecture. Later decorative carving was presented on various wooden objects, beginning from massive columns and beams for the ceiling, and ending with trunks, caskets, Koran stands, book cases, pencil cases, musical instruments and tiny children\'s amulets. All of them generously convey the wealth of the traditional vegetative geometric ornament. Such trees as walnut, plane, juniper, elm and mulberry are often used by wood carvers.</p>

<p>The characteristic feature of the Uzbek school of&nbsp;wood-carving is that all products are made without the use of nails, but from a single block of pure wood. The identification and preservation of the beauty of the tree is one of the principles of the Uzbek folk masters. Thick carving patterns do not disturb the natural beauty of the tree, but reveal features of texture and color. There are numerous combinations of geometric and floral ornaments, with which masters decorate wooden products.<br />
<br />
A delicate and complex branch of modern process of wood carving in Uzbekistan is the production of <a href=\"[[~2845]]\" target=\"_blank\">musical instruments</a>. They are <a href=\"[[~2848]]\" target=\"_blank\">doira</a>, <a href=\"[[~2870]]\" target=\"_blank\">rubab</a>, <a href=\"[[~2850]]\" target=\"_blank\">gijak</a>, nagora, <a href=\"[[~2851]]\" target=\"_blank\">surnay</a> and others.</p>

<p>In ornamental flat-relief wood carving, Uzbek masters distinguish three main stylistic composition groups: bagdadi, islimi and pargori. Each group is characterized by its characteristic ornamental motifs and compositional constructions, as well as the methods of carving.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"woodcarving art in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/woodcarving-art-of-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"750\" /></div>

<h2>Styles of wood carving in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>The carving of the bagdadi style has the character of relatively simple geometric constructions. In the olden days, bagdadi varieties were used very widely to decorate household items. Further, characteristic samples of bagdadi style doors of the work of Samarkand and Bukhara craftsmen were shown.</p>

<p>At the core of islimi style are innumerable vegetative-geometric variations on the theme of the widely used classical islimi ornament, which has long been known throughout the Middle East.<br />
<br />
This ornament has strict canons for the ornamental forms and compositions. It consists of curling stems, dotted with buds, leaves, flowers, which are weaved into quaint medallions. The islimi ornament is performed in one of the Uzbek technique of flat-relief wood carving with the selected background, often with a rich finish of relief and background.</p>

<p>Pargori carving is a special kind of fine background thread. It is based on a geometric grid of circles, squares and triangles.</p>

<h2>Wood carving schools in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>The avowed centers of wood carving in Uzbekistan were and remain <a href=\"[[~339]]\" target=\"_blank\">Khiva</a>, <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a>, <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a>, <a href=\"[[~190]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tashkent</a>, <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Fergana</a>. Each school is distinguished by its carving technique and patterns.</p>

<p>Wood carving in <a href=\"[[~603]]\" target=\"_blank\">Karakalpakstan</a> is associated with the decoration of the nomadic dwellings – yurts. The doors, interior items - lockers, food stands, dishes, musical instruments, horse harness, tools were adorned. Karakalpak carving wood has an ornamental character with a predominance of geometric, plant and zoomorphic motifs, often archaic. In the past Karakalpak masters widely used in their woodworking an overhead bone, finished with geometric engraving, and a kind of inlay with red cloth, efficaciously combining these techniques with flat-relief Uzbek carving. But wood was painted in dark brown and black tones. The decorative wood carving is not forgotten by modern masters of Karakalpakstan. Carvers continue to make musical instruments and various utensils. The modern art of wooden sculpture is also being actively developed in modern Karakalpakstan.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek woodcarving\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-woodcarving.JPG\" width=\"750\" /></div><br />

<p>Since the XVIII century the most bright style features of wood carving are expressed in the Khorezm school. Its foundations were laid by masters who created the decor of the Khiva <a href=\"[[~821]]\" target=\"_blank\">Juma mosque</a>. The whole ceiling of the mosque was covered with wooden beams, which are supported by 212 columns with a height of four to five meters. The surface of the columns is covered with vegetative relief in combination with a geometric one. Each column is remarkable not only for the high art of carving and the richness of the ornament, but also for the harmony of proportions, the original design of the lower part of the trunk in the form of a jug with flowering shoots of plants. This form of the column with insignificant interpretations is firmly rooted in traditional construction practice throughout Uzbekistan. Somewhat later, magnificent wood carved doors with a medallion pattern and carved wooden columns inserted into the base of ornamented marble were created for the palace of Khiva Khan <a href=\"[[~772]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tash-Khauli</a>.</p>

<p>Since then and up to now, in traditional Uzbek architecture there are three varieties of carved columns. They can be cut from a single piece of wood. Sometimes a wooden column is inserted into the stone base and, often, the column and base are cut from the tree separately and connected with the help of a construction in the form of a pin. Columns are decorated with spherical bases “kuzagi” and stalactite cornices “makarnas”. Sometimes their tops are crowned with capitals “kalla”. But most often the column is connected to the ceiling by means of figured carvings, which gives all its appearance lightness and harmony.</p>

<p>In the second half of the 20th century, the remarkable Khiva master A. Palvanov with his adherents reached the heights of real art. Samples of their wood carvings are presented not only in Uzbekistan museum expositions. After visiting the city-reserve Khiva, the traveler can knock at one of the carved wickets in the narrow streets of the ancient city. And travelers will be invited by hospitable owners to the courtyard surrounded by aivans with ornamented columns.</p>

<p>A special style of woodcarving was developed in the Fergana Valley. In <a href=\"[[~2788]]\" target=\"_blank\">Juma Mosque in Kokand</a> the overlap of aivan rely on 98 carved columns from such a hard elm tree, that it was called \"stone\". The columns are carved together with the bases, and carving is not only an ornamental decoration, but also a certain artistic image, organically fitting into the architectonics of the structure.</p>

<p>In the late XIX - early XX centuries Tashkent was another major center of wood carving. &nbsp;In Tashkent&nbsp;school&nbsp;of&nbsp;woodcarving along with the artistic design of architectural structures, a significant place in the work of masters was occupied by household carving. To a large extent this was due to the capital status of Tashkent, a significant part of the population of which was the Russian population. Multifaceted tables, boxes, and other objects were covered with exquisite carvings with the help of a circular (pargor). That is why the technique itself was called “pargori uyma”. Tashkent carved doors of this period are distinguished by a two-three-plane carving of flat-relief type, mainly of vegetative ornamentation.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Wood carving in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/wood-carving-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"750\" /></div>

<h2>Uzbekistan wood carving today</h2>

<p>Despite all the trials and vicissitudes of fate, Uzbek woodcarving remains one of the most popular types of decorative art. Carved doors and columns become an integral part of the decor in the construction of public buildings, museums and religious buildings. The natural texture of the tree, the stability of ancient traditions, the warmth of skilled hands, transferred by the craftsman to his work, make wood carving of Uzbekistan especially attractive to humans in the modern world of high technologies.</p>

<p>Today, following the centuries-old art traditions, Uzbek masters of wood carving of the new generation make their invaluable contribution to the preservation of such a unique kind of folk art as woodcarving.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek jewerly\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/Uzbek-jewerly.JPG\" width=\"800\" /></div>

<h2>Historical facts about jewelry finds in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>The earliest jewelry found on the territory of Uzbekistan is attributed to the time, when there was not yet Bukhara, <a href=\"[[~190]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tashkent </a>or Samarkand.</p>

<p>The most ancient find was discovered at the sources of the <a href=\"[[~2840]]\" target=\"_blank\">Chirchik river</a>. There were bracelets from bronze, on which cosmological spirals were depicted. No less interesting is the Amudarya treasure, which represents unique products of Bactrian jewelers who lived in the 5th century BC. There is a truly sensational find from the settlement of Dalverzintepe in the Surkhandarya region: there were found a huge number of Uzbekistan gold and silver jewelry.</p>

<p>Near <a href=\"[[~598]]\" target=\"_blank\">Termez</a> at the site of the ancient settlement of Balalyktepe there is a wall painting of the 6th century with scenes of feasting. The noble ladies depicted gold rings and earrings with pendants, reminiscent of the traditional jewelry of modern Uzbek women.</p>

<p>Images of jewelry are found on other early medieval murals from <a href=\"[[~595]]\" target=\"_blank\">Afrosiab</a>, as well as on ancient (two thousand years old) antique sculptures and small plastic.</p>

<h2>History of jewelry in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>The origins of the birth of Uzbekistan\'s jewelry art are lost in the depths of millennia. At the beginning of the XIX century jewelry art appears in all its ethnographic characteristics, in a wide variety of forms, materials, techniques and types of products.</p>

<p>In the XIX - early XX, jewelry production covered many types of art crafts. Zargars (Uzbek masters-jewelers) made filigree finishes for scabbards and dagger arms, details of horse equipment and men\'s belts with overhead and gold plated plates and plaques with inlay with precious stones. But their main occupation was the manufacture of a variety of women\'s jewelry.</p>

<p>In addition to jewelry, the masters decorated weapons, falconry, richly ornamented dishes and small household products made of precious metals. Jewelers participated in the design of leather bindings for manuscripts with metal slots and clasps.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"golden jewerly in Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbekistan arts/golden-jewerly-in-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<p>Material for jewelry in the XIX - early XX centuries were such metals as gold, more often silver, less often alloys such as electra, bronze; gems - ruby, garnet, beryl; colored stones - turquoise, carnelian, lapis lazuli; marine fossils - coral, pearls, shells of kauri; colored glass.</p>

<p>In the first half of the XIX century throughout Central Asia jewelry was made from silver. Gold items were made only in the khan\'s palaces and, mainly, in the palaces of the Bukhara emir. The Uzbek jewelers worked mainly on the local aristocracy - the nobility, the clergy, the merchants, who formed the main circle of customers of valuable jewelry.</p>

<p>At the end of the XIX - XX century in the Uzbek jewelry art can be traced two trends. The first trend was closely associated with the traditions of folk art, and the second one was guided by the tastes of the well-off strata of the population, who became the main consumer of expensive jewelry.</p>

<p>Thereupon, the material value of jewelry is increasing, which explains the spread among the local population of gold products imported from Russia. A large number of imported factory jewelry of Russian and Tatar masters, which gained wide popularity among the Uzbek population, was imported. In this regard, local handicraft production had to withstand strong competition, resulting in a noticeable deterioration in the quality of local jewelry. Jewelers have moved to the facilitating and accelerating process of manufacturing products - stamping. The labor-intensive embossing was replaced by a less expressive chasing on the matrices, and so on. Decorations began to be of larger sizes, often leaving them hollow inside and copiously decorating with colored glasses, sequins, mirror pieces, colorful silk threads. As a result, the former artistic merits of traditional Uzbek jewelry art were lost.</p>

<p>But in the middle of the XIX century the jewelry art of Uzbekistan reached an exceptionally high artistic level. There are new forms of products, their ways of wearing and color matching, caused by a change in consumer tastes. Jewelries are harmoniously associated with the lines and color of the national costumes. Along with it in the jewelry art, the feelings of proportionality of form and monotony of color in the ensemble of ornaments are especially pronounced.</p>

<p>In 1920s jewelry art in Uzbekistan changed. It has acquired simpler and more modest forms and colors. In place of complex multi-tiered decorations with an abundance of pendants and colorful stones more monolithic, clear in silhouette decorations came. In these conditions, ancient forms of adornments of Bukhara, Kokand, <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Fergana</a>, Khorezm, Surkhandarya, and <a href=\"[[~603]]\" target=\"_blank\">Karakalpakstan</a> have been preserved. They are earrings, bracelets, brooches and rings.</p>

<p>The art of jewelry in Uzbekistan of the XIX century represented a complex syncretic phenomenon, in which local foundations and imported foreign traditions merged. According to the historical chronicles, the masters-jewelries from India, the Caucasus, and Persia came here and worked.</p>

<p>Today, the jewelry traditions of Uzbekistan are being revived thanks to the families of craftsmen. In jewelry stores you can again see gold and silver items made in the classical style of the Uzbek jewelry school. The masters began to unite in the unions of artisans, and their works are increasingly appearing at specialized jewelry exhibitions. Interest in the unique style of Uzbek jewelers is growing every year, even outside the country. The jewelry art of Uzbekistan is a rich and original culture that begins to revive, preserving the knowledge and secrets of skill accumulated by the ancestors for millennia.</p>

{{<p>Unfortunately, the history of ancient Ferghana has been studied rather poorly, which is due primarily to the lack of written sources.</p>

<p>Among the lucky exceptions are the Chinese chronicles of the end of the 1st millennium BC, covering in sufficient detail the relationship between the Celestial Empire and the state of Dayuan which occupied all or most of the modern <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Ferghana Valley</a> and subsequently became part of the <a href=\"[[~3461]]\" target=\"_blank\">Great Silk Road</a>.<br />
<br />
It is generally accepted that the Silk Road was discovered by Chinese diplomat Jian Lin in the 2nd century BC.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Ferghana horses\" height=\"713\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan legends/Ferghana-Horse.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<p>Jian Lin\'s diplomatic mission dragged on for 13 years. In particular, he had a chance to visit Dayuan (Ferghana), about which he made a detailed description.</p>

<p>The main news that aroused the interest of the monarch concerned breeding in Dayuan a special breed of horses - beautiful, hardy and sweating in blood, which allegedly testified to their heavenly origin. The Chinese called these horses \"heavenly\" - \"shanma\".<br />
<br />
It should be noted that at the described time the problem of providing horses was extremely sensitive for China. The empire waged continuous wars with its northern neighbors, annoying it with regular raids. It was possible to strike retaliation against the steppe only with a large cavalry, which was excluded due to the lack of developed horse breeding among the Chinese: their horse breeds did not differ in physical qualities.</p>

<p>That is why the emperor Wu-di came in joyful excitement in 104 BC. He hastily sent the embassy to Dayuan, headed by the nobleman Che Lin, who was entrusted with persuading the people of Dayuan to accept Chinese citizenship and immediately sell the “heavenly” horses for the Chinese army.</p>

<p>As it turned out, the Ferghana people of that time had specific ideas about hospitality. However, perhaps, they were upset by the arrogant tone of the ambassador, who demanded immediate submission. In any case, the proposal was rejected, and the Chinese ambassador, returning home, was robbed and killed at the direction of the Dayuan prince Mugua.<br />
Upon learning of Che Lin’s sad fate, the emperor was extremely angry and immediately sent a punitive expedition to Dayuan.</p>

<p>However, the strength of the corps of Li Guang Li was clearly not enough to join Dayuan. More than half of the warriors died on the way to Dayuan from cold and illness. After several skirmishes and a bloody siege, it became clear to the Chinese that the capital of the country - the city of Ershi - could not be taken. With the surviving warriors, Li Guang Li was forced to go to China for help. About 15% of the troops returned to their homeland.</p>

<p>The emperor was again beside himself with rage and ordered to prepare a new campaign to Dayuan.<br />
<br />
Thus, in 102 BC at the next attempt of the Chinese to defeat Dayuan, the Ferghana peopledeclared that in the event of the fall of the city all valuable horses would be killed by them, which would deprive the Chinese of the main trophy. In the event of a ceasefire, the Dayuan people was ready to give horses and generally submit to the will of the emperor.</p>

<p>Li Guang Li and his generals reasoned that it would be wiser to accept the Ferghana proposal.</p>

<p>After the siege was lifted, 300 “heavenly” horses were handed over to the Chinese,. As compensation to the winners, 3,000 heads of ordinary horses were also handed over; In addition, Ferghana was obliged to send 2 “heavenly” horses to the Celestial Empire annually.</p>

<p>Starting from this period, China regularly received valuable horses from Ferghana, which allowed to gradually improve local horse breeding. In subsequent centuries, the Chinese troops won many victories thanks to fast and hardy horses. The exterior of the bronze winged horses found in the burial place of a Chinese general near Uwei in Gansu province (2nd century AD) undoubtedly indicates the Ferghana origin of their breed.</p>

<p>It is curious that the location of the city of Ershi has not yet been determined. In 1948, the famous Soviet archaeologist, Academician A.N. Bernshtam - put forward a hypothesis according to which Ershi was on the site of the Markhamat settlement in the south of Andijan region. One of his arguments in favor of this particular area was associated with cave paintings on Aravan rock.</p>

<p>Aravan rock rises above the village of Aravan, 20 km from Osh. Here in 1891 a cave was discovered on the walls of which an unknown author from about the 1st century AD - 1st century BC left an image of a hunting scene. Silhouettes of depicted goats with thrown back horns indicate the Scythian style of writing. The figure also shows a horse and a mare with a foal, the perfect forms of which suggest a connection with the thoroughbred horses of the Chinese chronicles. The Markhamat settlement is located 18 km from Aravan along the course of the Aravan Say rivulet.<br />

{{<p>In this article we will talk about two legends about Bibi Khanum. Which of this is true, and what fiction is up to you. That\'s what legend is.</p>

<h2>Legend&nbsp;of&nbsp;Bibi Khanum&nbsp;mosque, the 1st version</h2>

<p>The name of the mosque - Bibi Khanum - is very poetic, as is the legend associated with its construction. According to legend, Bibi Khanum, the beloved wife of Timur, built the mosque in honor of the return of her husband from a campaign in India. According to her plan, the mosque was to become the most ambitious creation of Samarkand. The architect, who directed the construction of the mosque, fell madly in love with the beautiful queen and in every possible way delayed the completion of the work. Bibi Khanum was furious at this delay, since Timur was due to return very soon, and the building was still not ready. When the queen demanded that the architect hurry up with the construction of the mosque, the architect set a condition for her: the building would be ready on time if she allowed him to kiss her.</p>

<p>In response, the queen ordered the servant to bring eggs painted in different colors, and said to the architect: “Look at these eggs. Only in appearance they are all different, but inside they are the same. Such are we women! I can give you any of the slaves you wish”. Then the architect asked to bring two glasses: one of them he filled with water, and the other with white wine: “Look at these glasses - they look the same. But if I drink one, I won’t feel anything; if I drink another, it will burn me. That is love”!</p>

<p>So the queen had to agree with the conditions of the impudent architect, but his kiss was so passionate that a bright trace remained on the gentle cheek of Bibi Khanum. Timur returned from the campaign. He was delighted with the gift of his wife - a majestic cathedral mosque, which was completed by the architect on time, but a kiss on the cheek of his beloved wife attracted his attention.</p>

<p>It is not known for certain how this story ended. According to one of the common versions, Timur killed the architect and ordered to bury him in the underground mausoleum, where he placed his library. After Timur’s death, this library passed to Ulugbek, who expanded it significantly, but after his death, it disappeared without a trace.</p>

<p>This legend of Bibi Khanum can be compared with real facts. Timur\'s eldest wife, Sarai Mulk Khanum, with the permission of Timur, decided to build a mosque for good purposes near the bazaar. Simultaneously with the building of the Bibi Khanum mosque, construction works of another madrasah according to the plan of Timur were going. In order the <a href=\"[[~775]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bibi Khanum mosque</a> was more magnificent than Timur’s Madrasah, the tsarina ordered the architects to erect one of the tallest buildings in the city of that period. But due to an error in the calculations, the building gradually began to collapse.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"631\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan legends/legend-of-Bibi-khanum-mosque.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<h2>Legend of Bibi Khanum, the 2nd version</h2>

<p>As we mentioned above, the name of the eldest wife of the formidable ruler appears in other legendary stories of past centuries, almost unknown to a wide circle of history buffs. In particular, one of them tells that Bibi Khanum was not of Muslim origin. In this regard respect there are some scientific evidence.</p>

<p>In the early 1870s, the Samarkand administration decided to expand the trading area of the bread market located near the Bibi Khanum Mosque. After the demolition of dilapidated shacks located about fifty meters east of the mosque, a small stone building was found in their place. Upon examination, a nameless tombstone was found. Under construction was a basement in which three more tombstones were found. They did not contain information about who was buried here. Nevertheless, specialists were able to determine the burial period - the era of Timur.</p>

<p>It must be said that the find stunned the archaeologists: all four tombs were stone sarcophagi. According to the archaeologist-orientalist V.L. Vyatkin (the one who dug up the Ulugbek observatory), it was completely unusual, the only such burial in Central Asia. Perhaps this fact served as the basis for the birth of a new legend about Bibi Khanum, Timur\'s former popular wife.</p>

<p>Rumors spread around the bazaar that every day a snake crawled out of the dungeon and, basking in the sun, was hiding again in its dwelling. Different versions of these stories had something in common, and this prompted local historian M. Rostislavov to write down the legend heard from the lips of a local old-timer. Soon the story was published in the Turkestan Vedomosti newspaper (1875, No. 27), and in 1898 it was reprinted by the Tashkent magazine of the Turkestan circle of archeology lovers. Since then, the legend of Queen Bibi Khanum was no longer published, and therefore remained unknown to the general public.</p>

<h2>The snake from the tomb or the appearance of the legend about Bibi Khanum</h2>

<p>According to local legend, the kind, wise and beautiful queen Bibi Khanum was Russian by origin and professed Christianity. Despite her disbelief, she, thanks to the wonderful qualities of her soul, enjoyed universal love and respect. Once, a certain holy fool predicted her death from a bite of a phalanx. Bibi Khanum worthily listened to the gloomy news. Then, summoning Timur, in a calm tone she announced about her near death and expressed her desire to be buried not according to the Muslim custom — in the earth, but according to the custom of her faith — in the grave.</p>

<p>Timur was very upset by the news. He did his best to distract his spouse from sorrowful thoughts, but she firmly stood her ground. And then the emir ordered the construction of a grand mosque in honor of his beloved wife, commanding the builders to use clay taken directly from under the building for their work. For this reason, an extensive dungeon was formed under the mosque. When the construction was coming to the end, the queen was invited to inspect the building, which she was pleased with.</p>

<p>Some time passed. Once Bibi Khanum, surrounded by close women, was sitting at the dastarkhan (eastern table) and laying out grapes. Suddenly she felt a sharp pain in her hand, and then she saw a running phalanx. Frightened women called Amir Timur. Bibi Khanum, smiling calmly, reminded him of the holy fool\'s prediction and repeated her request for burial according to Christian traditions.</p>

<p>The harsh lord fulfilled the will of his beloved wife. The deceased was dressed in rich clothes, a double necklace of corals and pearls was put on his neck, the coffin lid was hammered with gold nails, and the coffin was placed in a stone sarcophagus.</p>

<p>Rumors about this quickly spread throughout the city. One night, ten thieves entered the burial vault. They pulled out gold nails from the coffin, and removed the precious necklaces from the deceased. Not having time to get out, they began to share the booty. But the thieves could not go out: a snake crawled out of the dungeon and killed them with its poison.</p>

<p>The people who had gathered in front of the mosque in the morning realized that the dead men found at the tomb were punished for their crime by an unknown force. Now it was necessary to return the stolen things to the place, but no one dared to do it.</p>

<p>Then one old man came forward. He read the prayer, took the stolen things and, entered the building. He reverently put the jewelry in place. However, when he wanted to go back, the door to the tomb suddenly closed, so tightly that no effort could open it again. The poor old man was buried alive in this crypt. Since then, no one has attempted to enter a gloomy building guarded by a snake.</p>

<p>Today the Bibi Khanum Mosque is one of the most popular places for tourists to visit. If you are also interested in this mysterious building, <a href=\"[[~171]]\" target=\"_blank\">come to Samarkand</a> within the<a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\"> tours around Uzbekistan</a>.</p>

{{<p>There are few cities where so many diverse and noncontemporaneous monuments of material culture and art are concentrated. One of the few cities is <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a>.</p>

<p>The oldest of the architectural monuments have a history of more than a thousand years. And with each attraction there is a legend carefully preserved by the people. So is the kubba Chashma-Ayub (12th century), located in the city park of culture and leisure.</p>

<p>Saint Ayub is known both in Islam and in Christianity (as Job).</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"633\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan legends/legend-of-Chashma-ayub-complex.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<p><a href=\"[[~804]]\" target=\"_blank\">Chashma-Ayub complex</a> (translated as «Source of St. Jacob») was erected in the 14th-16th centuries. This building is not noticeable in anything, neither in buildings nor in architectural decoration, but it is still extremely popular among the people, because it is consecrated by a number of beautiful legends. According to the first legend of Chashma-Ayub complex, one of the 12 prophets, Saint Jacob, was buried here. It always excited the people of all Maverannahr and sacred Bukhara.</p>

<p>According to another legend, the sanctuary of St. Ayub was the last bastion of defense of Bukhara from the hated and wicked, dirty Genghis Khan. The Mongols could not in any way take it by attack, which became a worthy fortress to the enemy. And then the despicable dogs - enemies - decided to besiege the fortress and wait for the death of the great Uzbek sons - defenders from hunger and thirst. Then Saint Ayub rose from the grave, looked at his defenders, did not say a word, went into another room and hit his staff on the ground. A well arose immediately and spring water flowed from it, which does not end to this day. The spring flows out of its blessed waters. Enemies did not take this fortress. They left home, marveling at the courage of the heroes, illuminated by the rays of St. Ayub.</p>

<p>Another Chashma-Ayub legend tells of the arrival of Job in Bukhara. These were times when people suffered from prolonged drought. They asked Job for help. He began to pray, hit his staff on the ground, where a source of water appeared, which brought salvation to the locals.</p>

<p>According to another legend, Ayub was an immaculate and righteous man. For his righteous life, God gave him cattle, honor and peace in a family with seven sons and three daughters. Tempted by the devil, God began to doubt that Job would remain just as grateful and assiduous in his prayers if everything was taken from him. God decided to test the faith and patience of the righteous, and therefore Job lost all his property and children due to thieves, lightning strikes and storms. But Job said, \"God gave, God took.\" Then the devil punished him with leprosy, so that Job\'s whole body was covered with purulent ulcers. And yet Job continued to say: \"God gave, God took.\" Having believed in the cleanliness of Job, the Lord returned his wealth and children to him and ordered him to strike the ground with his staff. This will reveal the source from which he must wash in order to recover again.</p>

<p>Today people also believe that the water in the spring has healing power, therefore pilgrims come here constantly.</p>

<p>Chashma-Ayub complex includes ziyorathona - a room for performing the ritual of remembrance, ziyara – a room for worship, chillakhona - a room for forty-day solitude and meditation, gurkhona - a crypt with the imaginary grave of the holy prophet Ayub (St. Jacob) and a holy well with a spring.</p>

{{<p>Tourists who <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">come to Uzbekistan</a> usually immediately go to historical cities located on the ancient <a href=\"[[~3461]]\" target=\"_blank\">Great Silk Road</a> - <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a>, <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a>, <a href=\"[[~339]]\" target=\"_blank\">Khiva</a>, <a href=\"[[~509]]\" target=\"_blank\">Shakhrisyabz</a> and others. And there is really something to see and enjoy. Impressions are guaranteed. However, on the territory of the republic there are many other interesting objects that can attract lovers of travel and leisure. Today we will walk along the ancient paths of the highlands of the Tashkent region. Many people know such unique places as Sidzhak, Nanai, Pskem. But few people know about a city like Shahjuvar. In this article you will learn about the history of the city and the beautiful legend of Shahjuvar.</p>

<p>Located on the left bank of the Pskem River, Shahjuvar arose in the VI century A.D. as a processing center for non-ferrous metal ores, deposits of which are located nearby. The city was growing rapidly, crafts were developing. Shahjuvar turned into the economic center of the upper reaches of Pskem in the X-XII centuries. It lay on the shortest route from Chach to the medieval cultural regions of the Talas Valley (Kyrgyzstan). Pack paths, running through mountain passes, went along the channels of the mountain rivers Maidantal, Chiralma and Oygaing, from the confluence of which the Pskem River forms.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"legend of Shakhjuvar\" height=\"713\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan legends/legend-Shakhjuvar.JPG\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<p>The city, which was very difficult in style, was a heavily fortified horseshoe-shaped citadel. It is worth noting that in the general defensive system of the city, the features of the mountainous terrain were used to the maximum. A clear system of irrigation agriculture, urban water supply, were created here as an indispensable element of the improvement of the medieval cities of Central Asia.</p>

<p>The archaeologist Mikhail Tikhonin worked here with his colleagues in the 80s of the 20th century.</p>

<p>During the excavation, three semi-underground type baths were opened. Such baths were widely known in Central Asia and countries of foreign Asia. Baths in the East served as a measure of the prosperity of the city. Their construction was given special importance. Ancient coins found during excavations testify to the development of civilization and trade in those distant times.</p>

<p>The city flourished, craftsmen created amazing ironworks. By right, Shahjuvar can be called the city of iron masters. And iron is power.</p>

<p>People began to learn from the great Nature and did everything not only to live, but also to create in the arms of huge mountains. But another force, military, much superior, much more experienced, defeated Shahjuvar. Enemies attacked civilians.</p>

<p>Thousands of arrows pierced the body of the city. The tips of the enemy arrows were found in the walls of the houses and in the fragments of the iron garments of the defenders of the city that have survived to this day.</p>

<p>About the courage of the defenders of the city says a folk legend about Shahjuvar.</p>

<h2>Beautiful legend about Shahjuvar</h2>

<p>“ Far from the depths of Talas, where the greenery is adjacent to the melting snow, a song flew to the walls of Shahjuvar, which swiftly shot up into the sky. And like a golden bird, the ringing power of love burst into the house where the young beauty, the daughter of a blacksmith, lived. And love scorched her and blushed her.</p>

<p>The beloved called her, the larynx tunes of his distant land captivated her soul. They said that the blacksmith did not cherish the soul in his only daughter. He also remembered the swarthy guy from Talas with his amazing dombra (musical instrument). They only once saw each other. But tulips bloomed in a special way in that valley where two young hearts met.</p>

<p>Rumors worse than each other reached the city. The enemy was approaching, he was terrible and merciless. Only ashes remain after him.</p>

<p>The blacksmith began to prepare for war. The door of his forge did not close, hundreds of swords, arrowheads were made according to the best models of warrior teachers.</p>

<p>The city defended for a long time. The strength of the defenders was exhausted. Women and young girls ran high up into the mountains. But the blacksmith\'s daughter fought to the last, standing next to her father.</p>

<p>Enemies took her for the young man. But a strong jerk tore off her headgear, and black curls scattered over her shoulders. She flew up like a bird on the burning wall of the blacksmith’s house. Through the flames, her figure was visible. She flew from wall to wall until she climbed the highest part of the citadel. Below, Pskem carried its waves majestically. And suddenly the wounded daughter of a blacksmith fell down to the very depths of the blue river.”</p>

<p>Where Maidantal combines with two other rivers and forms Pskem, there is a small boulder on which a miracle can be often observed. The stone shimmers in the sun when a silver fish swims up to it. And for a long time talking a huge stone and a small fish.</p>

<p>They say that the bridegroom of the blacksmith’s daughter turned to stone here on Maidantal, waiting for his beloved. He was petrified with grief when he learned about the death of the city. Only when one fine day a silver fish swam up to him and touched him with his scales, only then did the stone change its color. He began to overflow. They say when a silver fish appears next to a stone, a dombra melody is heard in these places. You just need to hear this music with your heart.</p>

<p>Thus, the power of Eternity is realized - in the beauty of these places, in the strength of these mountains. A boulder lives, a silver fish lives. And they talk together about love.</p>

{{<p>On the northern outskirts of <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a>, on the edge of the Afrasiab hill, among the vast ancient cemetery, there are groups of mausoleums, among which the grave of Kussam, the son of Abbas, the cousin of the prophet Muhammad, is most famous.</p>

<p>Kusam ibn Abbas with a small part of the troops was appointed to Samarkand to establish Islam and introduce the fundamentals of the Shariat (\"Muslim law\"). According to Arabic sources, Kusam held up to seventy battles near Samarkand with local idolaters who, as a result, were converted to Islam. But, in 676, the heathens of the Pejikent Mountains unexpectedly attacked Samarkand, in which at that time the Muslims were busy with prayer and all were killed.<br />
<br />
The very fact of the death of Kusam ibn Abbas was not authentically confirmed in the sources that have survived to our time. Therefore, the only evidence that tells us about the \"death\" of the brother of the Prophet is a legend about Shahi Zinda passed down from generation to generation. But since the East is a “delicate matter”, the legend itself, depending on the narrator, differs in some details:</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"legend of shakhi-zinda complex\" height=\"754\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan legends/legend-of-shakhi-zinda-complex.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<h2>Legend about Shahi Zinda, version one</h2>

<p>During the attack of the pagans, the minbar (a place for prayer, according to one version) under Kussam split, and he, passing into the formed gap, disappeared from the eyes of infidels and remained alive. Hence the name - Shahi Zinda (\"Living King\").</p>

<h2>Legend of Shahi Zinda, version two</h2>

<p>Kussam, fighting off enemies and getting a lot of wounds, with the help of St. Hazret Khizra who came to the aid, reached the Shaaban well and hid in it, where he continues to live until now.</p>

<h2>Legend about Shahi Zinda, version three (which is still the most popular)</h2>

<p>Having almost reached the well, Kussam, nevertheless, received a terrible blow with a saber, his head was chopped off, but he, taking his severed head in his hands, descended into the well, where he receives immortality after drinking “living water”.</p>

<p>It is in this exposition that one can hear today the story of the events of 676 from the guides and from the pages of numerous guidebooks. The great Amir Timur heard the same version.</p>

<p>And with his name that another legend about the “Living King” is associated</p>

<h2>History of Shakhi&nbsp;Zinda, version four (after more than 7 centuries)</h2>

<p>Amir Timur returned from a long hike to his capital Samarkand. Timur conquered many lands, brought a lot of property to Samarkand. The emperor was glad to have a successful campaign and was cheerful, but, before starting to celebrate his victories, before giving himself a rest from hardships and military labors, he wished to worship at the graves of saints, many of whom were buried in Samarkand. Timur drove up to the well in which Shahi Zinda had disappeared from pagan enemies. Then Timur fell into doubt - is it true that Shahi-Zinda, the great and revered saint, is alive? He told his companions that he wanted to know for sure whether it was fair that Shahi Zinda had not died. He promised untold wealth to the daredevil, who would go down to the well.</p>

<p>One man from among the warriors, named Hida agreed to come down the well. Having gone down, Hida looked around and saw a cave in one side of the well. He boldly entered the cave and saw a palace similar to the treasury of Faridun (the epic Persian king). Hida walked around the palace, and, finally, he entered a huge garden, so beautiful that it had never been on earth.</p>

<p>For a long time adored Hida wandered around the wonderful garden. Passing it, he saw a beautiful vast green meadow, the end of which was not visible. Many horses grazed in this meadow. All of them were saddled with gold saddles with a set of precious stones; the bridles were the same on them; but the shepherds were not visible. Next, Hida saw a palace with a high terrace. As he approached, he saw a crowd of two hundred thousand men in front of the palace - some were dressed in white, others in green.</p>

<p>On the terrace of the palace Hida saw an old man in white shiny clothes; on the right and left next to him two more old men sat. Gaining courage, Hida respectfully approached the people standing around the palace and asked: “Who is this great man and what are the names of those two noble elders sitting with him?”<br />
<br />
Hida got the answer, that the man sitting in the middle is Shahi Zinda Kussam, son of Abbis; sitting on the right is the prophet Khizr, and on the left the prophet Ilyas. The people around are the souls of future people and the souls of deceased righteous people. All of them, by God\'s command, gather here every day to bow and serve the Hazrat (saint) Shahi Zinda, and then fly away on the horses east and west, around the world.</p>

<p>With an angry gaze, Shahi Zinda looked at Hida. Hida was a brave, fearless man, but even from this look he changed his face, shook like a sheet and fell to his knees. Shahi Zinda bowed his head and thought. Finally, Shahi Zinda raised his head and spoke to him with these words: “You have committed a daring act, descending into a well and appearing between the souls of righteous people. Weren\'t you afraid to annoy me with your anxiety? Didn’t you know that, at my order, they could make you a participant in the permanent peace, bring you into a primitive, pre-earthly form? If I do this, then I will get rid of other impudent people like you, who may also wish to go down the well and visit for the sake of curiosity in the realm of pure souls”.</p>

<p>Hida, in fear, began to make excuses that he had to go down the well, but Shahi Zinda said: “You are a liar and you are not afraid of God. Amir Timur did not forcibly order you to be lowered into the well: self-interest brought you here: you came down voluntarily in the hope that Timur promised you wealth and honors. This time I will give you life and forgive your action, but with the condition that you somehow do not tell your king or anyone else anything you see here so that you keep all this secret. “If you reveal a secret, you will not fulfill my desire, you yourself will go blind and all your offspring will be born blind. Remember punishment and do not reveal secrets. Now return home, but be afraid another time to bother me! ”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Hida had to tell Amir Timur about what he saw under pain of death.</p>

<p>Hida told in detail everything that he saw and heard, adding nothing from himself and not hiding. As soon as he finished - two large dark tears rolled out of his eyes and he went blind. Everyone was amazed at this miracle. Since then, the descendants of Hida were born blind - everyone knew about this in Samarkand. Amir Timur kept his promise: he built in Samarkand the Madrasah (Khorazmi Madrasah), in which the blind lived, mostly descendants of Hida.</p>

<p>The punishment predicted to Timur was fulfilled. Already he conquered the whole world, only one kingdom of China was not subject to him. Timur gathered his myriad army. No one doubted victory. The army came out.</p>

<p>The Chinese king was frightened when he found out that invincible Timur was coming to him, he wanted to give all his kingdom to Timur without a battle so as not to shed blood in vain, and sent ambassadors with rich gifts to meet him. But at that very time Timur died before reaching the border of the Chinese kingdom, and his army was dispersed.</p>

{{<p><a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a> is one of the oldest and largest cities in Central Asia, which for many centuries has played an important role in the history of society and has repeatedly been the capital of the states that formed on the territory of <a href=\"[[~133]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbekistan</a>. Century after century, many generations of Bukhara people contributed to the construction of the city, which became the \"City-Museum\".</p>

<p>According to Siyavush and Afrasiab legend, the most ancient monument of Bukhara is the <a href=\"[[~767]]\" target=\"_blank\">citadel Ark</a>.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"534\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan legends/legend-of-siyavush-and-afrosiab.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<p><br />
<br />
At the gate of the citadel Ark is the grave of the cult hero Siyavush. There is a tradition that leads us to a distant time, linking the foundation of the fortress with the names of mythical characters of the most ancient epic of the peoples of the East - “Shah - name”, which was passed down from generation to generation. In the annals of the XVI century it is said that the creator of the citadel of Bukhara is Siyavush ibn Keykavus.</p>

<p>Siyavush is the radiant epic hero of Central Asian legends, a charming young man who was slandered by his stepmother.</p>

<p>Having escaped from his father, Siyavush crossed the Jaihong, hiding from the claims of his stepmother, reached a rich country, which was stretched in an oasis of the desert. The daughter of the king of this country Afrasiab captivated the young man with his beauty, but the king set him a cunning condition. He threw a bull skin and ordered to build a palace that could be located on this skin. Siyavush turned out to be even more cunning. He cut the skin into thin strips, which he tied together and made a big circle. Inside this circle, he built a large palace, according to the legend of which the Bukhara Ark arose. The king gave Siyavush his beautiful daughter and gave him all his property. Siyavush wanted to leave a mark in these countries, for he knew that life was fleeting and would not show him loyalty. Siyavush decorated the city with a high palace, orchards and precious flower gardens.<br />
<br />
Enemies created hostility between Siyavush and Afrasiab and he killed Siyavush. He was buried in the same citadel, inside the fortress, at the entrance to the eastern gate. These gates are called Kakhfurushon, which means “a seller of straw”, and are also called “Guriyan Gate”. Honoring this area, every year on Navruz holiday for donation, people bring one rooster there before sunrise. They also say that during the construction of the citadel, it collapsed and remained so for many years. The chronicle tells of numerous cycles of revival and destruction of the fortress, assaults and sieges.</p>

<p>Today Ark is a large earthen elevation, which in its shape is close to an irregular rectangle. The building is somewhat elongated from west to east, and its southeastern corner is slightly cut off.</p>

<p>But according to the historian Narshakhi, there is a legend in connection with this. He wrote in his book that the citadel collapsed in an incomprehensible way, every time it was finished building. And only when one wise stargazer advised to build walls according to the outline of the Big Dipper, Ark ceased to collapse. And indeed, its irregular quadrangle resembles a constellation.</p>

{{<p>Between the hills of <a href=\"[[~595]]\" target=\"_blank\">Afrosiab settlement</a> in contemporary <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a>, on the shore near the small tributary of Zerafshan - Siyobcha, there is an amazing place, the blessing of which is felt almost physically, and even the birds seemed to protect the reigning peace.</p>

<p>The keepers of the Mausoleum and local residents will tell you that the relics of Daniel, the Old Testament biblical prophet, are buried here. Others will say that here Daniyor lies, a companion of the Arab preacher Kussam ibn Abbas. Still others will offer the version that Daniyar is a local saint, who had earned special respect among the townspeople, but both the one and the other agree in one thing - a saint lies here, and representatives of all three world religions come to bow to him.</p>

<p>It is believed that the spirit of the Saint buried here patronizes Samarkand, protects it, brings prosperity and wellbeing. Samarkand people and many people who come here believe that a prayer service at the Mausoleum will help them cope with illnesses, difficulties and bring good luck.</p>

<p>Pilgrims pay special honor to the spring, which beats at the foot of the Mausoleum. Sweet mineralized water is not only tasty, but also healthy. They get drunk, washed and take with them in plastic bottles - add to drinking water, bathing and washing water. Historically educated in the spirit of tolerance, practical Samarkand people pay tribute to all their shrines and enjoy their benefits.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, historians, researchers and tourists recall that there are several Mausoleums of St. Daniel in the world that claim to be official (in Israel, Iran, Iraq, Turkey), and they again ask the question - who is buried in the Samarkand mausoleum?</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"St.Daniil legend\" height=\"549\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan legends/StDaniil-legend.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<h2>The legend about St. Daniel, version one. Amir Timur brought the relics of St. Daniel to Samarkand.</h2>

<p>Legend tells that at the turn of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Great Timur launched a military campaign in Asia Minor, during which one of the small towns in Iran, Susa, was besieged. The city, however, did not give up. It was incredible - the professional army of the great commander tried, but could not break the resistance of a small town. Analyzing the situation, Amir Timur turned to the locals and his spiritual teacher. Then he received the answer that the spirit of Daniel himself, the Old Testament Jewish prophet, guarded the city.</p>

<p>Timur announced the end of the siege, the legend continues, and turned to the townspeople with a request to lead him to the burial of the Saint. He spent some time at the relics, convinced the authorities to put them to the ground (as the religions of the One God require), and the next morning he sent a caravan to Samarkand with ashes from the grave of the Saint.</p>

<p>According to another legend about Daniel, when the caravan reached Samarkand, the camels suddenly stopped at a place resembling Susa, and the sign was understood. Here the ashes of the Saint were buried, and the Mausoleum was erected.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can hear the version that ashes should be understood as part of the relics of the Saint, which is unlikely. Islamic tradition forbids disturbing the remains of the dead and requires their immediate burial. Knowing this very well, Timur could send earth (also called “dust”) to Samarkand from the burial place of the Saint.</p>

<p>This circumstance can explain the length of the tombstone (it is more than 10 meters). The logic of those who built the mausoleum could be based on the fact that the ashes from Susa mixed with Samarkand land could no longer be removed or stolen.</p>

<p>However, a number of Byzantine sources claim that at the time of Timur’s campaign in Asia Minor, the relics of St. Daniel were already taken to Constantinople (although the Mausoleum remained in Susa). Historians also state that the sources studied so far have not been able to provide an unambiguous reference to the events described in this legend.</p>

<p>There is also a version that the ashes from the grave of St. Daniel were brought to Samarkand in the V-VI centuries by immigrants from Mosul (modern-day Iraq), where one of the official burial places of the prophet Daniel is located. Theoretically, they could do it, but again, there is no evidence for this in well-known historical sources.</p>

<h2>The legend about Prophet Daniel, version two. The biblical Prophet Daniel lived and died in Samarkand.</h2>

<p>Adherents of this version note that the prophet Daniel, who survived all the Babylonian kings, could serve among the Persians who liberated the Jews from the Babylonian captivity. The version tells that the Great Darius could make an exception and appoint Daniel as his satrap in Sogdiana, the capital of which was Samarkand. However, this version is also not supported by historical sources.</p>

<h2>The legend about Prophet Tabba, version three. The remains of the prophet Tabba lie in the Mausoleum.</h2>

<p>This version is mentioned in “Kandia Malaya” (a literary and historical work of the 17th century), which refers to the words of the Samarkand sheikh Khoja Abdu-Darun that “... the prophet of God crossed the river Jeykhun (Amu Darya) and reached Samarkand. He was a skilled fortuneteller. The population of the city respected him. He settled here and died in Samarkand. In Arabic, he was called Tabba Nabi (the Prophet Tabba). The Prophet said: \"I am Muhammad, the son of Abdullah, I have acquired the perfection of knowledge of the innermost world at his grave.\" And everyone who wants to become a gifted revelation, should every Friday after Friday prayers serve on the kubba of the prophet ...\"</p>

<p>It is interesting that Khoja Abdu-Darun lived in Samarkand in the 9th century. And the Mausoleum of the Saint appeared on the bank of the Samarkand rivulet 4-5 centuries before Timur.</p>

<h2>The legend about St. Daniyar, version four.</h2>

<p>In the Mausoleum are the remains of Daniyar, an associate of Kusam ibn Abbas.</p>

<p>This version is reported by the Arab historian Abu Tohir Khoja in his work “Samaria” (late 19th century). He writes that many confuse Daniel with the Arab righteous Khoja Daniyar, who arrived in Samarkand to spread Islam along with Kusam ibn Abbas himself, the cousin of the prophet Muhammad. According to this version, Khoja Daniyar enjoyed special respect among the Samarkand people.</p>

<p>Many stories are also associated with the length of the grave. The servants of the mausoleum repeatedly rebuilt the tomb, claiming that in especially prosperous years the Saint’s bones grow. Thus, to date, the length of the grave has reached 18 meters. They say that the hand of Daniel will grow until the whole planet is encircled by it, and then paradise will come on Earth. According to another legend, Timur decided to build a tomb of such a length that enemies and greedy people could not find the relics.</p>

<p>These and other versions are worked out by historians and archaeologists and, possibly, the world will soon learn the history of the mysterious Mausoleum and the legend about St. Daniel. But while the Samarkand land keeps its secrets, Muslim, Jewish and Christian prayers of people who have arrived in Samarkand to fill their hearts and souls with the light of holiness are heard at the Mausoleum.</p>

<p>Patriarch Alexy II, who visited Samarkand in 1996 during the celebration of the 125th anniversary of the Tashkent Orthodox Diocese, noted the unusualness of this place and even allowed himself to linger here more time. The \"very blessed place\" - repeated the Orthodox Bishop, measuring the steps of the ancient shrine.</p>

{{<h2>Leopard - a symbol of courage, honor and nobility among different nationalities</h2>

<p>Symbolic signs have been known in the East since time immemorial. With the advent of private property, the need for personal signs appeared, which were inherited along with property and became a kind of \"birth certificate\" of the founder of the clan.</p>

<p>There are strong beliefs in Tibet that saints can turn into snow leopards.</p>

<p>The Vakhs, an ethnic group living in the mountains of northern Pakistan, China, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, have a belief in mountain spirits. These are women who turn into snow leopards, and who, with proper treatment and respect, help local residents.</p>

<p>In the Turkic-Mongolian “feral” calendar with a 12-year cycle, instead of the Tiger year was the year of the Leopard. According to popular beliefs, this year was considered especially successful.</p>

<p>The leopard in mythological representations of the Sax-Scythian peoples was the defender of justice.</p>

<p>According to the ancient Kyrgyz epos Manas, the tribal Kyrgyz nobility Begi led its family tree from mythical ancestors - leopards: \"I killed seven wolves. I didn’t kill leopards and fallow deer” - the ancient Kyrgyz wrote at grave epitaphs.</p>

<p>In the 7th century, the ancestors of the Kazan Tatars - the Volga Bulgars - considered the winged leopard a symbol of wealth, fertility, nobility and the patron of their state. The leopard was considered a sacred animal, so it was portrayed with a sign of holiness - wings.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Legend of Leopard Samarkand Symbol\" height=\"586\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan legends/Legend-of-Leopard-Samarkand-Symbol.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<h2>Leopard - a symbol of Samarkand</h2>

<p>For many centuries, the mighty Leopard has been the permanent symbol of Samarkand. The inhabitants of the city composed the legend about Leopard.</p>

<p>According to the legend, when the <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">city of Samarkand</a> was founded, a leopard – «palyang» descended from the Zeravshan mountains. He approached the city walls, and proudly, like the king of animals, began to go around all the residential buildings and city walls. Then he went back to the mountains. Since then, the inhabitants of Samarkand began to be called leopards.</p>

<p>Since that time, for the inhabitants of Samarkand, Leopard is not just a strong and courageous animal; he has become a real symbol of the city. The leopard is depicted on the banner and coat of arms of the city. He symbolizes power and the Sun. Leopard with the Sun blazing on his back adorns the Sher-Dor madrassah, as the personification of the ruling person. His strength and power are equal to the power of the Earth and Heaven. Therefore, only Leopard can carry the vital Star.</p>

<p>Samarkand leopard symbol is found not only in architecture, but also in handicraft production.</p>

<p>They say that the symbol of the lion was brought to the lands of Samarkand by the Iranians, but under the Arabs and Turks it was replaced by the symbols of the leopard. And since then, he personifies the strength and power of Great Samarkand.</p>

<p>Everyone who enters the city is greeted by Samarkand Leopard, who raises his paw forward. This gesture means that the city sincerely welcomes its guests and wishes them good and prosperity.</p>

<p>Note that Leopard with a blazing Sun on his back is not only depicted on the <a href=\"[[~765]]\" target=\"_blank\">Sher-Dor Madrasah building</a>. He can also be seen on the Uzbek national banknote of 200 sum.</p>

<h2>Leopard - the symbol of Samarkand</h2>

<p>The modern emblem of Samarkand was approved in July 1994. The base of the coat of arms is a red shield - a symbol of the protection of the city. In the center there is a snow leopard with wings. Below there is a golden wave-like line, symbolizing the <a href=\"[[~2843]]\" target=\"_blank\">Zarafshan River</a>, \"bearing gold.\" In the upper part of the coat of arms there is a seven-pointed turquoise star - in the East a revered sign of perfection, the unity of science, art and architecture.</p>

{{<p>Dear tourists, let us tell you a beautiful legend about Uzbekistan. The legend is beautiful and after reading it, perhaps you will have a desire to <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">visit Uzbekistan</a> together with our company Peopletravel.</p>

<p>At the beginning of time, after the Most High created the earth, he conceived to distribute it among the nations, so that everyone would get it, and no one would be offended.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"legend of Uzbekistan\" height=\"713\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan legends/legend-of-uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<p>The peoples gathered in line, there was an Uzbek among them. And the Uzbeks in those years were as welcoming, good-natured and polite as they are now. The Uzbek let everyone forward in front of him, bowed down to everyone, patted him on the shoulder, said, “Markhamat, Markhamat, come in, please, I\'ll wait, Markhamat”, he smiled and generally felt great among other nations.</p>

<p>But then, finally, the Almighty gave the lands to all, and there one Uzbek remained - “Eh, where have you been before, my son? I have already distributed all the lands, ”said the Heavenly Father. “Oh, creator, answered the Uzbek, you always instructed us to be merciful and kind, to respect others. All these peoples are my friends. And here I am, a servant of God, I have come to call on my heart and your instructions. Therefore, I stand before you last. \"</p>

<p>The face of the Almighty brightened; he was surprised and generously smiled at the Uzbek “My son, Uzbek! You have a truly generous soul! For this, I will give you the best land that I have in store for myself. Now let this land, like paradise, where flowers are fragrant, trees bloom, green grass grows, emerald rivers flow and beautiful animals live, be the land of your people! ”</p>

<p>The Almighty said so and gave the best land that lies between two rivers, in a wonderful valley, protected by impregnable mountains.</p>

<p>Here is such a legend about Uzbekistan.</p>

{{<p>Many of us love silk for its softness, lightness, and for the pleasant sensations that silk delivers when it adheres to the body, and for how it flows along the figure. Silk is magnificent and we all know that silk, for the most part, was made in China. Later thanks to the <a href=\"[[~3461]]\" target=\"_blank\">Great Silk Road</a> the technology spread to Central Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Here we will talk about Uzbek silk - the khan atlas.</p>

<p>«Atlas» translated from Arabic means \"smooth\". By its nature, an atlas is a dense silk fabric with a special type of weave (only on the upper base there is a more valuable fiber), with a shiny and smooth surface.</p>

<p>Khan atlas is made in <a href=\"[[~133]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbekistan</a>, the largest production is in the <a href=\"[[~578]]\" target=\"_blank\">city of Margilan</a>. The production of silk fiber, like many centuries ago, is based on the cultivation of silkworm. This is a worm and it eats leaves of a mulberry tree.</p>

<p>At the moment, the whole production is automated, before everything was done manually. And such a khan atlas, hand-woven now is a rarity, the so-called khan atlas from chests. Because it can only be purchased from hands from stocks of people, that is, from chests.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Legend of khan-atlas\" height=\"634\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan legends/Legend-of-khan-atlas.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<p>What is the beauty of the khan atlas? It is unique and inimitable, it is always different. Khan atlas is a concentrate of all the colors of the rainbow. And this wonderful kind of silk was born not by chance.</p>

<h2>The legend of the khan atlas</h2>

<p>Once, one of the rulers of Margilan decided to marry for the fifth time. He saw the artist’s young daughter, fell in love and decided that she would be the fifth wife. The artist was upset when he knew about the intention of the Khan, came to the palace and asked him not to touch his daughter. Then Khan said that he would abandon his intention only if the artist created something more beautiful than his daughter by the next morning. The artist could not eat and could not sleep all night. At dawn, he went to the creek. The saddened artist sat down in thought on the bank of the stream, looked into it, and a rainbow was reflected in it. The artist burst into tears and when tears fell in the stream, the rainbow rippled and presented the artist with a wonderful drawing. The artist understood what his salvation was, and wove an extraordinary fabric in the image of what he saw - light as a cloud, cool as mountain air, and reflecting all the colors of the rainbow. By the morning, the master brought his creation to the khan. He was shocked by the beauty of the fabric and ordered him to be called \"khan-atlas\" (\"khan\'s silk\"), and he gave the artist\'s daughter a wife to his beloved son.</p>

<h2>Advantages of khan-atlas</h2>

<p>Uzbekistan loves its fabric and traditionally sews costumes and dresses for girls and women.</p>

<p>Khan atlas is spruce and at the same time it cools in the heat. Of course, many interpretations appeared. From varieties of colors to the material on which this drawing is applied, khan atlas has become a household name and now there is velvet khan atlas and cotton.</p>

{{<p>The unique “window” into the Past, opened to us in <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a>, gives a rare chance to escape from the hustle and bustle of modernity. To stop in order to see the frozen \"music\" embodied in Bukhara mosaic and ganch patterns. ceiling paintings and stalactite decorations. To scoop up water from holy sources. To hear the “silence of heaven” in Sufi khanaka. To touch the stones of the mausoleums of the sacred persons. To be surprised by the blue sky, \"pierced\" by Kalyan minaret.</p>

<p>This article will focus on Kalyan minaret, and more specifically on the legends associated with Kalyan minaret.</p>

<p><a href=\"[[~769]]\" target=\"_blank\">Minaret Kalyan</a> (\"The Great\") has become the main symbol of sacred Bukhara. For a thousand years, this sacred tower has dominated Bukhara, declaring the greatness of the Islamic faith.</p>

<p>Many legends are associated with the highest minaret in Central Asia. But it has one more name - the Tower of Death, since earlier people condemned by the rulers were dumped from it.</p>

<p>One of the legends about Minaret Kalyan says that in ancient times the shah lived. He was cruel, wayward, a bad ruler and spent all his time in pleasures. The shah had a wife who tried to help people and correct the situation in the state. But, fearing her husband, she did it in secret.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"legend of Kalyan minaret\" height=\"544\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan legends/legend-of-Kalyan-minaret.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<p>Once the secret was revealed, and an angry husband ordered his wife to be thrown from the Death Tower. The woman was smart. On the eve of the execution, she asked her husband to fulfill one of her wishes. He agreed. The day she was supposed to be executed, she put on all her dresses and skirts.</p>

<p>All people came to say goodbye to their patroness and stood around the minaret. The Shah’s wife climbed a tall minaret and took a bold step forward. But what was the surprise of the people and the Shah himself, when she did not break, but landed smoothly. Surprised by the courage and cunning of his wife, the shah had mercy on her.</p>

<p>Another legend of Kalyan minaret tells about the master-architect Bako, who, having laid the foundation of a minaret made from a mixture of alabaster and camel milk, disappeared for two whole years and returned only when the foundation became strong enough to begin brickwork. The master was afraid that the khan would rush the construction and this would lead to the collapse of the minaret, as this had happened in 1121.<br />
<br />
According to another legend about Kalyan Minaret in Bukhara, Genghis Khan himself was forced to bow to Kalyan minaret. After the conquest of Bukhara by Genghis Khan, most of the structures of the old city were destroyed by his order. Kalyan minaret was also to suffer the same fate, but when Genghis Khan threw back his head to look at the top of the tower, a helmet fell off his head. To lift it off the ground, the great warrior had to bend down. He put his helmet on his head and said: \"I never bowed to anyone, but this building is so grand that it deserves a bow.\" Kalyan minaret was not destroyed by the conquerors; it also resisted strong earthquakes, which more than once tested its strength.</p>

<p>There is another historical fact that the “minaret” in Arabic is a lighthouse. And that in pre-Islamic times they really served as lighthouses in the desert. Bonfires were burned on their peaks at night, by the light of which night caravans were oriented. And the caravans went only at night, because during the day it was a little hot. Here is a legend, but it’s quite possible.</p>

<p>Today, Kalyan minaret is one of the most outstanding buildings of the Muslim East, a business card and one of the main attractions of Bukhara.</p>

<p>Kalyan minaret is built of burnt bricks. It has the shape of a round tower with a height of 45.5 m, its diameter at the base is of 9 m and 6 m at the top. The surface of the minaret is decorated with 12 belts of geometric ornament, some of which include Kufic writing. The minaret indicates the year of construction – 1127, and the name of the architect - Bako is mentioned.<br />
<br />
Inside the tower there is a spiral staircase with 104 steps. At the top there is a lantern with 16 arches, decorated with stalactites. Earlier, the upper link of the minaret was located above the lantern, after the loss of which a modern superstructure appeared here. The upper part of the Kalyan minaret was damaged during shelling and aerial bombardment of Bukhara by the Red Army in 1920 and as a result was restored.</p>

{{<p>It is impossible to imagine the daily diet of the <a href=\"[[~3140]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbek people</a> without one gastronomic miracle - unique in taste and nutritive qualities and never bored with hot tandoor bread “Issik non”, and in common parlance - flat cake. Everyone who has tried this bread at least once falls in love with it for life. And even tourists leaving Samarkand rush to get to the bazaar and buy the famous Samarkand cake.</p>

<p>But what do we know about this blessed bread, besides the fact that it is surprisingly tasty, and \"that there is no such bread anywhere else\"? What is its secret?</p>

<h2>Unique legend about Samarkand bread</h2>

<p>There is a legend of the Samarkand flat cake, telling about how once having tasted a Samarkand cake, the ruler of the Bukhara Khanate wanted him to bake the same cakes. Having recognized the ingredients, the bakers in Bukhara baked flat cakes, but, alas, the taste turned out to be completely different than that of Samarkand. Then the ruler ordered that a baker be brought from Samarkand, who would bake the very flat cakes. The servants found the best baker of cakes in Samarkand, brought him to <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a>. He baked cakes, but after tasting them, the khan was again upset - that was not the taste. But the ruler at all costs decided to achieve his goal. He ordered a tandoor, in which cakes are baked, and all the ingredients of the recipe from <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a>. When all this was delivered to Bukhara, the baker again baked cakes, but they still did not have the same taste as the Samarkand ones. Then the ruler became furious. He began to inquire from the Samarkand baker, what is the secret of Samarkand cakes. The baker calmly replied: \"Probably the air is not the same as in Samarkand!\" The Bukhara khan was ready to order to bring air from Samarkand, but then he became thoughtful, smiled and let go of the baker. Henceforth the khan ordered Samarkand cakes from Samarkand.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"legend of Samarkand bread\" height=\"714\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan legends/legend-of-Samarkand-cakes.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<h2>What determines the taste of Samarkand flat cakes?</h2>

<p>Of course, the taste of cakes depends not so much on air as on water, flour and the furnace in which they are made. A significant role is played by the baker’s ability to accurately follow the traditional recipe, verified over the centuries, thereby conveying its original taste. The Samarkand cake is baked from ordinary dough on a special sourdough, which gives the bread a unique taste. Preparing dough for tortillas correctly is not a simple science and not everyone masters it. Experienced bakers are worth their weight in gold not only in Samarkand, but throughout the world.</p>

<h2>How to bake the Samarkand flat cake in the tandoor?</h2>

<p>From ancient times, the Samarkand cake was baked in the tandoor. Tandoor is a furnace of a special type of semicircular design with an opening in the wall or in its upper part. The cakes made of dough are glued to the walls of the tandoor and baked in this way until cooked. If the cake in the baking process has come off the wall, it is considered sacred. The temperature inside the tandoor is very high, and the cakes are baked in it in a few minutes. When the flat cakes are ready, the baker takes them out of the tandoor with a special spatula or mittens.</p>

<h2>Customs related to the Samarkand bread</h2>

<p>For a long time there is a custom according to which, if a person leaves the house, he must bite and eat a piece of Samarkand bread. The flat cake itself should be kept at home until the person returns. When the traveler returns, he must finish it.</p>

<p>In Uzbekistan bread is very revered. Once upon a time there was an old national tradition of carrying a basket with flat cakes on the head. This meant a special respect and reverence for bread.</p>

<p>Even during the marriage ceremony, one does not forget about the Samarkand cake. It is customary for the eastern peoples to carry out the traditional ritual of breaking bread - most often the traditional wedding bread is a flat cake.</p>

<p>Traditionally, flat cakes are not cut with a knife, but broken by hands. Moreover, putting broken pieces of tortillas “face” down is strictly prohibited by table etiquette. This is considered disrespectful attitude to bread.</p>

{{<p>There is a legend about the curse of Tamerlane. It says that the Great Patriotic War was the result of the opening by Soviet archaeologists of the tomb of the medieval Turkic commander and conqueror Tamerlane in Samarkand. It happened in June 1941. Is there a connection between these events? And was there really a curse of Tamerlane?</p>

<p>On March 21, 1941, Stalin got the letter from the cultural commissariat asking for permission to excavate at the <a href=\"[[~776]]\" target=\"_blank\">Gur-Emir mausoleum in Samarkand</a>, where, according to historians, the remains of the great commander of antiquity rested.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"legend of Timur\'s curse\" height=\"533\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan legends/legend-of-Timur\'s-curse.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<p>Having received permission, the expedition flew to Samarkand. And already on June 1, in the morning, scientists began excavating.</p>

<p>On June 5, the first burial was opened. Presumably, it was the grave of Ulugbek - the great astronomer and at the same time grandson of Tamerlane. It is known from history that the enraged guardians of the Islamic faith executed Ulugbek, cutting off his head.</p>

<p>When archaeologists lifted the lid of the coffin, they saw a half-rotten human skeleton, next to which a skull was. All doubts have disappeared: this was indeed the grave of an astronomer.</p>

<p>Finally the day of the opening of the tomb of Tamerlane came. It was June 21. On this day, work began as never before - from seven in the morning. Soon a plate was discovered on which archaeologists read a strange message.</p>

<p>It began by listing the 16 names of Tamerlane. Then the text followed: “We are all mortals. The time will come, and we will all leave ... \" The inscription ended with a terrible warning: \"If anyone disturbs the ashes of ancestors, let him suffer punishment.\"</p>

<p>All those present at the word “punishment” were seized with mystical horror. They recalled the warning of the Sufi sages, who foretold to those who would disturb the dust of the great commander, innumerable troubles. They even wanted to suspend work. But the whole world was already talking about the expedition, and Stalin was particularly interested in its results.</p>

<p>Although the opening of the tomb was prepared very carefully, the work did not work out: the winch broke. And the workers began to complain of dizziness and a feeling of internal alarm.</p>

<p>The attempt to repair the winch did not lead to anything, and the heavy slab had to be moved manually. Finally, as a result of long and intense efforts, a black hole opened. But in it, instead of the expected ashes of Timur, there was ordinary land.</p>

<p>This was followed by a dialogue with local old-timers, during which one of the old men presented an old folio. It said: “You must not touch the ashes of the great commander. Otherwise, the war will begin”.</p>

<p>Despite a convincing argument, after a break, excavations continued. Finally, clearing the sand, archaeologists saw three plates. When they were moved, the coffin lid opened. It was 2 p.m. It was at this time that all the lamps in the tomb suddenly went out. The audience was again in alarm.</p>

<p>After an hour and a half, the light in the tomb appeared again. And then they opened the coffin lid. There were the remains of a man whose height was no less than 185-190 cm. There were few doubts at that moment that it was the ashes of Tamerlane. The last doubts were dispelled by the damaged patella. Because of this wound, Timur the rest of his life fell on his left foot.</p>

<p>But on this a strange chain of mysterious events related to the crypt of Tamerlane did not end. It just so happened that in 1942, Kayumov, already a front-line cameraman, accidentally found himself near Zhukov’s headquarters. He decided to seize the opportunity and report to the marshal about what happened in <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a>.</p>

<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"legend about the curse of Tamerlane\" height=\"654\" src=\"images/Uzbekistan legends/legend-about-the-curse-of-Tamerlane.jpg\" width=\"950\" /></p>

<p>Having learned from Zhukov the truth about what happened in Samarkand on the eve of the war, about Tamerlane’s prophecy and a strange book predicting misfortune, Stalin behaved very inadequately to his character: he didn’t laugh at Zhukov, but took everything very seriously, immediately called Yusupov and ordered to bury the remains of Timur again.</p>

<p>On December 20, just before the battle near Stalingrad, the remains of Timur and his associates were buried.</p>

<p>As soon as Tamerlane’s ashes returned to their place, the situation at the front changed. By mystical coincidence or for some other reason, but on December 21 the first encouraging reports arrived from Stalingrad.</p>

<p>It’s hard to say what is true in this story, what are the inventions of idle journalists or what are just legends. For example, many are embarrassed by the episode of the three elders and their mysterious book, in which the prophecy was allegedly recorded. It would seem fantastic. But, as knowledgeable people say, such a book does exist, but only the person who is able to stop the disaster can read it by the will of higher powers.</p>

{{<h2>Geography and climate of Uzbekistan&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The geographical placement of Uzbekistan, which is located away from the oceans and seas, in the inner part of the Eurasian continent, causes its continental climate. The continental climate is expressed in cloudless weather in most of the year, in a high temperature in summer, in a small amount of precipitation in large evaporation of moisture, in the summer hot and duration, as well as the relatively cold winter in these latitudes, in large amplitudes of daily and annual air temperature. These features of the climate in Uzbekistan were influenced by climate generating factors.&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"> <img alt=\"Continental climate of Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/sights/continental-climate-of-uzbekistan.jpg\" title=\"Continental climate of Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" /></div>

<h2>Seasons in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>Uzbekistan is a sunny land, filled with warmth and light. It is typical for this region the high solstice throughout the year, as well as an abundance of warm and sunny days. Indeed, the number of sunny days in a year is more than 320.</p>

<h2>About summer in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>During the summer, the duration of the day is up to 15 hours, and in winter - about 9 hours. In summer on the flat part of the country there is a local turan tropical air mass. The air is dry and hot, and saturated with fine dust. The weather in Uzbekistan is resistant, the sky is always clear, cloudless; day is very hot, but it becomes cooler at night. The hottest 40-days period, called by local residents “chilly” continues from June 25 until August 5.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"> <img alt=\"Uzbek weather\"  src=\"images/sights/uzbek-weather.jpg\" title=\"Uzbek weather\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Here the area of a low pressure is formed that favors the penetration of the warm and more humid air from the north-west and west. However, the air quickly gets warm, and there is no precipitation.</p>

<p>Mountains, located in the eastern part of the territory, retain the humid air masses, resulting in the foothills and mountains precipitation falls. In summer, climate of Uzbekistan is cooler in the mountains, and there are more rains, winters are cold and prolonged, snow falls a lot. High in the mountains snow lasts all year, forming glaciers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Autumn in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>This season in Uzbekistan the weather is still warm and is does not much differ from summer. Therefore, the beginning of autumn is considered to be in October. Since that time, the weather in Uzbekistan begins to change, the days become shorter, the temperature is lowered. Sometimes frost falls at night. Infrequent rains occasionally pass into snow. In autumn there is 15-25% of annual precipitation. Fall starts earlier, cold weather comes faster in the mountains.&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"><img alt=\"Climate in Uzbekistan\" \" src=\"images/sights/climate-in-uzbekistan.jpg\" title=\"Climate in Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>When the average daily temperature drops below + 5 ° C, this is the end of the fall.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Climate of Uzbekistan, winter</h2>

<p>In winter Uzbekistan weather is hardly severe, rather warm with a few exceptions. January is the coldest winter month. Often in the morning the streets are veiled by thick fog. Snow falls is not very common, but usually it immediately turns to slush because of ensuing rain.</p>

<p>Continued from 26 of December to 5 of February the coldest period of winter is called winter chillya. During this cycle the cold air from the Arctic and Siberia is invading, weather fast changes, air temperature decreases. On Ustyurt, for example, frosts sometimes reach -38 ° C, in the Surkhandarya region -20 ° C. The winter in the mountains is more severe and lasts 3-4 months.</p>

<h2>Uzbekistan spring</h2>

<p>Spring in Uzbekistan is usually early. It is at the end of February - beginning of March. So to the Women\'s Day a romantic atmosphere with wonderful bouquets of tulips and yellow daffodils is formed.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"> <img alt=\"Seasons in Uzbekistan\" src=\"images/sights/seasons-in-uzbekistan.jpg\" title=\"Seasons in Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Sometimes in spring there are light frosts, which may be accompanied by snowfalls and damage gardening. 40% of annual precipitation falls in spring. Sometimes the rains fall as heavy showers, and then mud flows are formed in the mountains. Violent dirty and rocky streams destroy everything in their path.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In April - May, the air temperature rises, the air is warming up, there is less precipitation, summer begins.</p>

<h2>Best time to visit Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>The most favorable time for a guided <a class=\"in_text\" href=\"uzbekistan-tours/\" title=\"tour in Uzbekistan\">tour in Uzbekistan</a> is spring (April-June) or autumn (September-November). You can find a way and to come here in spring and summer. These are totally two different, but equally beautiful and amazing sceneries. Natural landscapes are very diverse and picturesque. On Uzbek territory one can found grim deserts and blossoming valleys, snow-capped mountain peaks of the Tien Shan and the flattened plains of the Ustyurt, wild rivers and quiet backwaters of reservoirs.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"> <img alt=\"Best time to visit Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/sights/best-time-to-visit-uzbekistan.jpg\" title=\"Best time to visit Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>Also, travelling to Uzbekistan at the end of summer, closer to the fall, you can taste sweet melons and watermelons, fragrant peaches, ripe and juicy pomegranates.</p>

<h2>Precipitation&nbsp;of&nbsp;Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>Precipitation in Uzbekistan is distributed unevenly due to the location of the country in the depths of the vast continent, the wide variety and intricacy of the terrain. The most arid is the western lowland area and the Ferghana Valley. From the plains to the foothills there are more rains.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\"> <img alt=\"Climate of Uzbekistan\" src=\"images/sights/climate-of-uzbekistan.jpg\" title=\"Climate of Uzbekistan\" width=\"690\" /></div><br />

<p>The dampest seasons of Uzbek weather in a year are spring and winter. Spring precipitation is 40% of the annual amount, and in some mountainous areas they are more. Summer precipitation is very small, and its share decreases from north to south from 20 to 1%.</p>

<p>The average annual rainfall is slight, so agriculture is more dependent on irrigation.&nbsp;</p>

{{<p>Special kindness, friendliness and hospitality of Uzbek people have long been on everyone\'s lips. But Peopletravel Сompany once again shows you the rich history, culture, spiritual life and the cordiality of Uzbek people; and offers <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">unique trips to Uzbekistan</a> not only to know but see from within life of the people.</p>

<h2>The Uzbeks are extremely hospitable and hard-working</h2>

<p>What traits are inherent for Uzbek people, not looking at what nationality they are? Firstly, it is diligence. People manage to grow good crops in almost desert areas. Accordingly, therefore, the Uzbeks modestly call themselves the most assiduous in Central Asia.</p>

<p>Attachment to family life and traditionalism reside in Uzbek people. Members of one family support each other, to honor and respect the elders. In addition, each family member knows his status in the social hierarchy and imposed rules of behavior: it is necessary to show respect to seniors by putting a hand to the heart, and it is obligatory be on formal terms with seniors.</p>

<p>Sense of duty, patience and optimism are the Uzbeks’ own distinctive features.</p>

<p>Settled life developed especially careful attitude to housing, court, affecting by their purity. It was essential not only to sweep the room and yard systematically, but also outside of the gate.</p>

<h2>The hospitality of inhabitants of Uzbekistan - the country\'s trademark</h2>

<p>One of the main peculiarities of the Uzbeks is cordiality. The ability to act as host is more appreciated among the Uzbeks than the wealth of the table or family’s income. Not to play as host means to dishonor the family, genus, makhalla (quarter of the city in Central Asia) and village.</p>

<p>In Uzbekistan people believe that it is necessary to let any guest in the house and in every way to show hospitality, because Allah himself can knock in the likeness of the stranger.</p>

<p>Honorable guests are hailed at the gates of the owners. Usually only men shake hands. During handshake men mutually are interested in health and state of affairs. Women are welcomed by a slight nod, with right hand to the heart.</p>

<p>It is considered a bad form to refuse the invitation for lunch or dinner, or come too late. The guests usually don’t come without souvenirs for the hosts and sweet gifts for children. Street shoes must be removed when entering the house. The master of the house himself should ask the guests to sit down.</p>

<p>Any conversation will not start without bowls of tea and a variety of treats. In Uzbekistan people like to eat well and tasty. A place of honor in the feeding system belongs to bread. It is baked in the form of cakes from wheat flour. <a href=\"[[~2711]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbek dishes</a> are varied, but the favorite dish is <a href=\"[[~2820]]\" target=\"_blank\">pilaf</a>.</p>

<p>An example of good Uzbek hospitality were the years of the Great Patriotic War, when Central Asian families took unfamiliar people, just those who needed help, and shared with them bread. But these rules of hospitality were originated in the hearts of the indigenous people many centuries ago and have preserved almost intact in modern life.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek people\"  src=\"images/Uzbek traditions/Uzbek-people.jpg\" width=\"700\" /></div>

<h2>Origin of the Uzbeks</h2>

<p>The origin of any people is always a very complex process, which for centuries leads to the origination of a new nation with a new name. And the name of the people often arises from the area, where people live, or the name of a famous ruler (or leader), as the name of the founder of new state. In history we find many such cases.</p>

<p>History of the addition of the Uzbek people comprehends dozens of centuries, and captures in a process many tribes, nations that are a part of people formation as essential historical terms, forming what is referred to historical science as ethnogenesis of the people.</p>

<p>More recently, in historiography of Central Asia naive and primitive view dominated. There is a statement that the Uzbeks are alien people that were in Maveranakhr only at the end of the XI century.</p>

<p>The Uzbeks, whom we have just mentioned, really came to the ground of Uzbekistan in the XV - XVI centuries, but they were the Uzbek nomads.</p>

<p>The Uzbek nation was formed as a Turkic-speaking people on the Uzbek territory for many centuries before the advent of nomadic Uzbeks in the settled areas of Central Asian, though did not wear their behalf. The people really got its name from Uzbek nomads, but it developed highly sedentary culture long before their arrival on the basis of the ancient Sogdian-Khorezm civilization.</p>

<p>Ancient ancestors of the Uzbeks were the Sogds, Khorezms, Bactrians, Fergans, Saks, Massagets. From the middle of the 1 thousand BC the Mongoloid groups of tribes begin to seep in Central Asia. From the time of Central Asia entry into the Turkic khanate, this process increased. In times of the state of the Karakhanids the Turkic tribes go to the settlement. All Turkic population of Mesopotamia formed the foundation of the Uzbek nation. The latest wave of Turkic-speaking nomads who joined the composition of the population of the area, were the Dashtikipchak Uzbeks, who came in with Sheibani Khan.</p>

<p>The Dashtikipchak Uzbeks included in this Turkic population, giving it their ethnonym \"Uzbek\" only as a last, most later ethnic stratification.</p>

<p>The process of foundation of the contemporary Uzbek nation proceeded also in the agricultural areas of Fergana, Zeravshan, Kashkadarya and Surkhandarya valleys and Khorezm and Tashkent oases. Consequently the modern Uzbek nation, which absorbed elements of these two worlds was formed here.</p>

<p>As we have noted the Dashtikipchak Uzbeks put the final point in the formation of the Uzbek people. They already were called \"Uzbeks\", as they saw themselves as citizens of the state of Uzbek Khan.</p>

<p>The Uzbeks on the map of the world appeared as the Uzbek nation state in 1428.</p>

<p>But there are several other hypotheses of the origin of the word “Uzbek”.</p>

<p>On G. Vernadsky’s opinion, the term Uzbek was one of self-names of \"free men.\" He suggests that the term \"Uzbeks\" was used as a self-united \"free people\" of various occupations, languages, religions and origins. He wrote: name Uzbek means \"master of himself\", meaning \"free man\".</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"people of Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/Uzbek traditions/people-of-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"700\" /></div>

<h2>The Uzbek language</h2>

<p>Formation of the Uzbek literary language is comprised of three historical periods: ancient Turkic literary language, old Uzbek and modern Uzbek language. In the 15th century, thanks to the attempts and works of Alisher Navoi, the old Uzbek language became the united and developed literary language, which rules and traditions have been preserved until the end of the 19th century.</p>

<p>Radical changes in socio-economic and cultural life of the Uzbek people positively affected in the evolution of the modern language. A significant place is occupied by the amount of borrowed international terminology, new words are created.</p>

<p>Lifestyle of Uzbek people, their way of survival in certain social settings played the crucial role in their formation. Different working conditions, economic and other relationships, the process of peoples’ dialogue developed certain habits, techniques and methods that became traditions of the Uzbek people.</p>

{{<h2>Uzbek currency. General information</h2>

<p>The official currency of Uzbekistan is the Uzbek sum. For today it is the only circulating medium in the country.</p>

<p>In time of the Soviet Union, when Uzbekistan was a union republic, the Soviet ruble was in circulation on its territory. In November 15, 1993 Uzbek sum-coupons were issued to protect the domestic market from the inflationary processes of the Soviet ruble. In July 1, 1994 the Central Bank of Uzbekistan introduced the current currency unit, which is still in circulation.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek money\"  src=\"images/Uzbek currency/Uzbek-money.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div>

<h2>Uzbek money and their denomination</h2>

<p>In active circulation there are banknotes of 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 5 000 sums. Currently, banknotes with a face value of one hundred sums and coins are almost never met.</p>

<p>In July 1, 2013, the National Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan issued a banknote worth up to 5 000 sum. In March 10, 2017, the same bank issued a new banknote with a face value of 10 000 sum.</p>

<p>The bonds of different value are notable for colors. The design and appearance of banknotes of Uzbekistan sums is quite special. On the obverse, however, the state emblem in the national ornamental frame is invariably represented in different variants. It is the characteristic for each next denomination of the banknote. The obverse of the Uzbek sum also shows the denomination in both digital and alphabetic formats in several places. The reverse of banknotes depicts monuments of architecture and memorable places of Uzbekistan. For example, a banknote with a face value of 1 sum depicts the <a href=\"[[~2260]]\" target=\"_blank\">Navoi Theater in Tashkent</a>; 3 sum - an architectural ensemble that is a national cultural monument of <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a>; 5 sum - a <a href=\"[[~3122]]\" target=\"_blank\">monument to Alisher Navoi</a> in an architectural frame; 10 sum - the mausoleum of the Timurid dynasty, which is a national and cultural monument of the past; 25 sum - the architectural complex of antiquity \"<a href=\"[[~764]]\" target=\"_blank\">Shahi Zinda</a>\", which is a national treasure; 50 sum - an architectural ensemble and a historical cultural monument in <a href=\"[[~697]]\" target=\"_blank\">Registan Square</a>; 100 sum - the Palace of Friendship Peoples in Tashkent; 200 sum - a fresco fragment depicted on the facade of the <a href=\"[[~765]]\" target=\"_blank\">Sherdor Madrasah</a>; 500 sum - the <a href=\"[[~795]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tashkent monument to Amir Timur</a>; 1 000 sum - the <a href=\"[[~2758]]\" target=\"_blank\">national state museum of the Timurid dynasty</a>; 5 000 sum - the building of the Parliament of Uzbekistan; 10 000 sum - the Senate of Uzbekistan in Tashkent.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek currency\"  src=\"images/Uzbek currency/Uzbek-currency.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div><br />

<p>The banknotes of sum-coupons of Uzbekistan were printed in the factories of securities in Germany; the notes of the Uzbek sum were printed at the national Mint of Uzbekistan in <a href=\"[[~190]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tashkent</a>.</p>

<p>Uzbek coins were made mainly of steel and were covered with bronze, nickel or brass. Uzbek coins were minted at St. Petersburg Mint. The coins issued in 1994 were called \"tiyin\" (a variable monetary unit). At present, the coins at 1, 5 and 10 sum are hardly used.</p>

<h2>History of Uzbek money</h2>

<p>The historical roots of the name of the Uzbek sum go back to the monetary unit that was in circulation in some Turkic peoples. Another version is that such money was valued in times of the Golden Horde: so people of the Golden Horde called silver ingots (often trough-shaped), weight of which was about 205 grams. The surviving documentary evidence says that the ingot could be melted into coins in any mint.</p>

<p>The notation of the concept is also interesting. The Turkic word \"som\" (\"Uzbek sum\") is translated as \"pure\". With regard to coins it can be translated as \"pure gold\".</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbekistan currency\"  src=\"images/Uzbek currency/Uzbekistan-currency.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div>

<h2>Uzbek money and exchange offices</h2>

<p>In most hotels there are exchange offices operating 24×7. You can also exchange money in most banks, as well as in exchange kiosks. As a rule, banks work from 9-00 to 16-00 hours from Monday to Friday, however in different branches the opening hours may differ. All banks do not work on public holidays, and some banks are closed for lunch breaks.</p>

<p>While exchanging money for Uzbek currency, ask for an official certificate on the exchange of money.</p>

<p>Pay attention that you ought to exchange money only in exchange offices or banks. It is illegally to exchange money in any other place, for example, in markets.</p>

<p>Such credit cards as Visa, Master Card and American Express are accepted in most <a href=\"[[~2131]]\" target=\"_blank\">hotels of Tashkent</a>. In this regard, you might not have problems during your <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">travel around Uzbekistan</a>.</p>

<p>In 2015, the national currency of Uzbekistan was given the title of the most beautiful banknote among other world banknotes (on a par with dollars from Barbados, Swiss francs and Iceland\'s kronas).</p>

{{<p>Literature and art of Uzbekistan is called one of the bright and wonderful pages of the history of the world artistic culture. Along with Egypt and Mesopotamia, Greece and Rome, India and China, Central Asia laid the foundations of human civilization. The emergence of a cultural phenomenon in Uzbekistan is mainly due to its geographical location in the Central Asian Mesopotamia, where agricultural centers have been formed since ancient times.</p>

<h2>Uzbek literature history</h2>

<p>The most ancient Uzbek oral literary works are over 200 epic poems, many legends, epic songs performed by folk poets - bakhshi. Heroes of folklore struggle with hostile forces - evil spirits, dragons. The oldest cycle of epic poems Ker-ogly and the poem Alpamysh were written around the 10th century. Alpamysh went in the folklore of all the peoples of Central Asia. It talks about the courage of folk heroes, courage and hatred of enemies; it contains many witty aphorisms, vivid metaphors, colorful descriptions. Another popular work from the cycle Ker-ogly is a poem about the transforming power of love of Ravshan-Hon. Many times later it was processed by folk poets. The satirical novels of Nasreddin Afandi, in which the khans and bais are derided, are popular. In the oral Uzbek literature, people of different nationalities - Chinese, Iranian, Turkmen, Negro, etc., female images are devoid of sentimentality.</p>

<p>In the XI century, many works are created, based on religious norms of Islamic morality. These are the instructive poems \"Kugadau Bilig\" (\"Knowledge of Grace\" or \"Science of Happiness\") by Yusuf Khas Hadjib Balasaguni, the poem \"Khibat al-Khakaik\" (\"Gift of Truths\") by Ahmad Yugnaki.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Alisher Navoi\"  src=\"images/Uzbek literature/Alisher-Navoi.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div><br />

<p>Classical literature in the language of Farsi played a huge role in the development of Uzbek written literature. Such monuments are of special cultural and scientific interest for all Turkic-speaking peoples, as it is possible to include Islamic didactic works created at a later time based on ethical norms, for example, \"Dictionary of Turkic dialects\" compiled by Makhmud al-Kashgari.</p>

<p>Fiction literature reached the flourishing in the historical epoch of Amir Temur and the Temurids. Its popularity is justified by the fact that the works acquire a more secular character, freed from excessive religiousness.</p>

<p>The study of the origins of the development of oral (folklore) and written literature in Uzbekistan convincingly attests to the intensive and dynamic interaction of the cultures of settled and nomadic peoples inhabiting this fertile territory. First of all, this applies to modern Afghanistan, the northern territories of which were part of the large Uzbek (Central Asian) state formations that were associated with the heyday of the genius of Alisher Navoi. He is considered the classic of Uzbek literature and the pioneer of the Uzbek language.</p>

<p>The last of the Timurid dynasty, Zakhiriddin Mukhammad Babur - was also famous as a bright poet of his time. His epic poem \"Baburname\" is a masterpiece of Uzbek literature, an estimable literal monument of that time.</p>

<p>Literary centers appeared in the 17th - 18th centuries. Most of the writers who took part in their activities, graduated from local madrassahs and, according to tradition, wrote in two languages ​​- Uzbek and Tajik. At this time in <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a>, <a href=\"[[~339]]\" target=\"_blank\">Khiva</a> and <a href=\"[[~805]]\" target=\"_blank\">Kokand</a> anthologies of poems of local poets appeared, which testified to a new upsurge of Uzbek literature. For example, during the rule of Muhammad Rahimkhan (1885-1910), a literary center appeared in Khorezm at the palace, which published poems of local authors collected by Tabibi in a special anthology of poetry. Naturally, in the works of court poets, the khan and his officials were song.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek literature\"  src=\"images/Uzbek literature/Uzbek-literature.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div><br />

<p>However, in addition to court poets and mystic poets, there was a place in Uzbek literature for people, democratically minded progressive writers and poets. In their sketchy prose and poetic works, they boldly exposed the vices of their time, hypocrisy, insidious tricks of khans and beks. Such writers, for the most part, lived in poverty and were persecuted. One of such courageous defenders of the people and opponents of his oppressors during the reign of Subkhan-kulikhan (1680-1702) was the brave Turdi (Farogi).</p>

<p>Among the democratically minded writers and poets, known for their profound and substantial works, a special place was occupied by Babarakhim Mashrab (1654-1711). Living in poverty and wandering, this great man in his satirical lines mercilessly ridiculed the oppressors of the people - the feudal lords, the beks and their lackeys. Mahmud and Gulkhani also painted in their works a true picture of the plight of the broad masses of working people and boldly exposed injustice and violence.</p>

<p>One of the prior representatives of Uzbek literature during the khan’s period was the excellent poet, translator and historian Muhammad Riza Ogakhi (1809-1874), known for his democratic ideas and progressive views. His humanism and patriotism were clearly manifested in the depiction of a merciless satirical pen of a true picture of the situation of the working people and exposing the injustice of the ruling circles.</p>

<p>Uzbek literature of the XVIII-XIX centuries was mostly lyrical, and was devoted to a love topic. During this period Nadira, Uvaysi, Mashrab, Khorezmi and many others created.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Alpamysh\"  src=\"images/Uzbek literature/Alpamysh.jpg\" width=\"564\" /></div><br />

<p>After the seizure of Turkestan by the Russian Empire, a new modern stage of Uzbek literature began. Its bright representatives were the poet Mukimi and the writer, poet and satirist Furkat. At the beginning of the 20th century there were such talents as Hamza Khakimzadeh Niyazi, Sadriddin Aini, Abdullah Kadiri and the philosopher Fitrat. Their literary traditions were continued by Oibek, Gafur Gulyam, Abdullah Kakhhar, Khamid Alimdjan, Uigun and others.</p>

{{<p>The dance art of the peoples of contemporary Uzbekistan has been developed since ancient times. In the rock paintings and archaeological finds images of dancing figures preserved. In the IV - VIII centuries the art of Uzbek dancers from <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a>, <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a> and Khorezm was known in many countries of the East.</p>

<p>The national Uzbek dance is very expressive. It embodies all the beauty of the Uzbek nation. The main differences of Uzbek dance from other dances of the East are, firstly, an emphasis on complex and expressive movements of hands; and secondly - a rich facial expression.</p>

<h2>Types of Uzbek national dances</h2>

<p>Uzbekistan national dance has come down to our days in two forms: traditional classic dance and folk dance. Uzbekistan folk dances are very diverse. These are hilarious, lyric, dramatic dances with their regional distinctions.</p>

<p>Classical traditional Uzbek dance is an art that is expanded in special dance schools, and then is shown on a big stage.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that performers of Uzbek dances should be agile and very precise in their movements, as every move of every part of the body, up to the fingers and eyebrows, contributes to the accuracy of the narrative. In Uzbek dancing, expression is as important as the technical execution of steps.</p>

<p>In the Uzbek folk dance there is an unusual variety. These dances come to life on all family, village and city holidays. These dances are transmitted from generation to generation, they retain the ancient dance traditions, as well as real or outgoing life. In the Uzbek folk dance almost all 12 regions of Uzbekistan are represented.</p>

<p>Like any folk dance, an Uzbek dance is a dance of individuality, the soul and body in it are united in a single whole. Performers sometimes do not have special training, well-trained equipment, however their movements are always emotionally accurate and expressive.</p>

<p>Each Uzbek folk dance is a mini-play: embroidery in gold, work in a cotton field, fruits picking, oriental bazaar or baking cakes in the tandyr.</p>

<p>Traditional dances of Uzbekistan, as a rule, narrate about any history or event, and do not serve for the self-expression of dancers. Their wide repertoire shows the importance of dance for the culture of the country.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek dances\"  src=\"images/Uzbek traditions/Uzbek-dances.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div>

<h2>Different schools of classical Uzbek dances</h2>

<p>In the classical Uzbek dance Fergana (\"Kagga Uyin\"), Bukhara (\"Dance of makom\"), Khorezm (\"Ufori makoma\") schools are popular.</p>

<p>The classical dance of <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Ferghana</a> is a lyrical dance with very rich movements of the neck and head, and serpentine hands. These dances are soulful, sincere, soft in performance, with smooth movements of head and shoulders, with a light flying tread and rounded swings of hands, drawing complex air patterns. The leisurely flow of the dance is replaced by gusty rotations and light elegant pirouettes.</p>

<p>This is a very florid style, in which dances are performed to music and songs, the texts of which are taken from classical literature. Expression and facial expressions are very gentle and soft, conveying nobility and purity, which are highly valued in the tradition of performance. Hand movements are similar to those we see in Uzbek dances, as well as in some Iranian, Afghan and other oriental traditions. Dancers perform Tanovar and Munajat - dance passages, imbued with high spiritual feelings, which are full of pathos and deep desire to reunite with one’s beloved.</p>

<p>Bukhara dances of Uzbekistan are proud, majestic, offensive; their movements are iridescent, like embroidered gold products of Bukhara needlewomen. The steppe of the Bukhara dancers is springy, with a tapping of heels. Bukhara dances have a myriad of impetuous circulations, hand movements are decorative and extremely emotionally saturated.</p>

<p>The sweeps of the hands and body are set to use the details of the costume, which also differs in its original character. The upper dress can be both stitched and wide, but more often it is wide and it is always made of heavier fabrics, for example, samite with embroidered gold thread patterns. The head is often decorated not only with a headdress, but also a long scarf, as well as massive ornaments. The Uzbek dancers wear bells on the wrists. The compositions are very joyful, energetic, facial expressions are animated. The technique also includes movements on the bent knees.</p>

<p>Khorezm fire, exciting folk dances with sharp movements, captivating with their temperament, especially men\'s dances to the accompaniment of original stone castanets - kairaks, require a virtuoso performance. The well-known Uzbek dancer Tamara Khanum wrote: \"In the dances of Khorezm there are many tender lyrics inherent in the Ferghana dance, the exquisite nobility of the dances of ancient Bukhara, and at the same time they are full of solar energy and saturated with an unusually vivid passion.</p>

<p>The playful and energetic style, Khorezm dance is usually performed at fast and increasing speeds. It is believed that the dances here come from ancient shamanistic customs and traditions of worshiping fire. Expression and facial expressions are close to ecstatic performance, especially in the Uzbek lazgi dance. Special feature of the movements are shaking with brushes, arms and shoulders and, so-called \"broken fingers\" movements.</p>

<p>There is a beautiful legend. In ancient times Khorezm was ruled by the king. The king had many concubines, but one of the concubines was particularly beloved. She could dance very beautifully. But she was in trouble. She broke the bones of her fingers. On some day the ruler ordered that she should dance for him and his guests. The concubine loved her master and could not refuse. The dance turned out peculiar. Everyone thought that this was planned. Since then, this manner of performance has become popular in Khorezm.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbekistan dances\"  src=\"images/Uzbek traditions/uzbekistan-dances.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></div><br />

<p>There was another character - dancer Anash. She was lame and her dance performance style also became popular.</p>

<p>They also say that the movements are like wriggling fish, if you pull it out of the water. And in performance, improvisation is highly valued, and not staged choreography.</p>

<p>The Uzbekistan dances of Surkhandarya and Kashkadarya also differ in playing plot and character. Archaeological data reveals the presence here of both dance and theatrical traditions. The costumes of Uzbek dancers are similar to those that can be found in the south of Tajikistan in Kulyab, but differ in more rich combinations of colors and ornaments. Dances are often performed with spoons and wooden sticks to the accompaniment of chang (<a href=\"[[~2845]]\" target=\"_blank\">musical instrument</a>).</p>

{{<h2>Geography of Uzbekistan: general concepts</h2>

<p>Geographically, Uzbekistan is located at about the same latitude as the Mediterranean states, such as Spain, Italy, and Greece. However, the <a href=\"[[~2831]]\" target=\"_blank\">weather conditions of Uzbekistan</a> are significantly different from the conditions of these subtropical states. This is explained by the fact that the territory of Uzbek republic is considerably removed from warm oceans and seas, as it is located inside the Eurasian continent. From the south, high mountains prevent the penetration of moist and warm air masses from the Indian Ocean, but the way to the cold air flows is open from the north. In this regard, Uzbekistan has a special climate peculiar to the desert (summer is cloudless, with lots of sunny days, arid, hot, and winter is relatively cold).</p>

<p>Most of the border of Uzbekistan passes along the plains, comparatively less - along the adyrs and mountains. Our country borders on 5 countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan. The whole length of the state frontiers is 6221 km.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbekistan map\"  src=\"images/geography of Uzbekistan/Uzbekistan-map.jpg\" width=\"700\" /></div>

<h2>Uzbekistan nature and geography</h2>

<p>Geography of Uzbekistan is mainly represented by deserts and mountains, and, in some areas - by valleys and lowlands.</p>

<p>Approximately 80% of Uzbekistan is presented by a desert, namely, the <a href=\"[[~2828]]\" target=\"_blank\">Kyzylkum desert</a>.</p>

<p><a href=\"[[~2670]]\" target=\"_blank\">Mountains of the country</a> are the foothills and lower mountains of the Tien-Shan system.</p>

<p>The highest point of Uzbekistan is the Mount Adelunga (4 301 meters).</p>

<p>Geographically the land of Uzbekistan is 448.9 thousand sq. km. In Central Asia in size of the territory, Uzbekistan is inferior to Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, but at the same time it occupies a large area compared to such European countries as Great Britain (2 times), Denmark (4 times), Switzerland (10 times) and Belgium (14 times).</p>

<p>However, despite its long form, the time of Uzbekistan is not scattered over several time zones. And it is +5 hours to Greenwich. And this is very convenient.</p>

<p>Uzbekistan has quite rich climatic, land, water and some other natural resources, as well as a number of minerals.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"geography of Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/geography of Uzbekistan/geography-of-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"700\" /></div>

<h2>Uzbekistan geography: relief and inland waters</h2>

<p>On the territory of Uzbekistan there are also deserted plains, among which the extensive desert of Kyzylkum stands out. There are mountains with high-zonal landscapes, low elevations, and inland waters. The complexity of the terrain, the features of latitudinal and high-altitude location provide a significant diversity of the landscape appearance of the territory.</p>

<p>In general, Uzbekistan nature and geography has experienced a strong impact of human activity, and the share of cultural and transformed landscapes in Uzbekistan is particularly high.</p>

<p>The territory of diluvial Uzbekistan arose as a result of Paleozoic mountain formation (about 300 million years ago). It was then when the Turan plate and the land formed. Later for a long time this plate had been covered by the sea. Mountain systems were finally forming a phase of alpine orogenesis; the products of the destruction of the uplifting mountains were carried to the plains and layered over the marine deposits. The growth of the mountains contributed to the drought of the climate, and gradually huge deserts appeared. Wandering rivers and winds repeatedly deposited the superfluous loose strata. So the sands of the Karakum and Kyzylkum were formed. The water content of the rivers and the moistening of the territory also changed.</p>

<p>Only in places where the Paleozoic foundation appears above the late deposits (for example, in the Kyzylkum) the island mountains arose. Only the Tien Shan and Pamir-Alai became really high mountains.</p>

<p>Each major natural region of the Republic is distinguished by its combination of relief forms.</p>

<p>Uzbekistan lies in the <a href=\"[[~131]]\" target=\"_blank\">Aral Sea</a> basin. The area, occupied by rivers and lakes is 4.92%.</p>

<p>Total water resources are 50-60 cubic km. per year. Only 12.2 cubic km. are formed on the land, and the actual volume of water comes from outside - from the mountains. Therefore, the maximum flow of water in the rivers comes at the hottest time.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbekistan Nature and Geography\"  src=\"images/geography of Uzbekistan/Uzbekistan-Nature-and-Geography.jpg\" width=\"700\" /></div><br />

<p>The largest rivers of the country are the <a href=\"[[~2838]]\" target=\"_blank\">Amu Darya</a> and <a href=\"[[~2839]]\" target=\"_blank\">Syr Darya</a>.</p>

<p>Flats in Uzbekistan do not participate in the creation of surface runoff, but they actively consume it. Here, the water coming from the mountains is being intensively disassembled for irrigation..</p>

<p>On the plains there are lakes and reservoirs: <a href=\"[[~2842]]\" target=\"_blank\">Sudoche</a>, Arnasai, Chardara, <a href=\"[[~2783]]\" target=\"_blank\">Charvak</a>, etc.</p>

<h2>The nature of Uzbekistan geographically</h2>

<p>The location of Uzbekistan in such a contradictory geographical environment served the fact that, going about the country, you can catch yourself thinking that you, while on the territory of one state, have visited several countries at once. So, for example, the western areas are more deserted, and are represented mainly by plains. And this makes <a href=\"[[~4]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbekistan tours</a> quite convenient and attractive. However, gradually approaching the eastern regions of the country, it becomes apparent how the landscape becomes more mountainous and sublime, and all this is crowned with snowy peaks of the Tien Shan.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"land and geography of Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/geography of Uzbekistan/land-and-geography-of-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"700\" /></div><br />

<p>The <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Ferghana Valley</a> can be counted the locality with the most optimal climatic conditions in Uzbekistan. It stretches between the north-eastern and south-eastern mountain ranges. Here the agricultural industry is developing, which allows the locals to conduct trades at internal and external markets.</p>

{{<p>For a long time a horse-drawn vehicle or arba (in Uzbek) has been the main mode of transport in Central Asia and, particularly, in <a href=\"[[~133]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbekistan</a>. It originated in ancient times. Arba is the first and simplest mode of transport, the emergence of which is associated with the development of cattle breeding, agriculture and folk art. Such carts were used to transport goods, people, and even for combat purposes.</p>

<p>Different studies make it very clear that in the past, horses were harnessed in the arba, camels less often. Much later donkeys were used mostly.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek arba\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/Uzbek-arba.jpg\" width=\"715\" /></div><br />

<p>In Uzbekistan, unlike other countries, only a two-wheeled arba was spread. The main feature of the arba in the northern part of Uzbekistan, <a href=\"[[~603]]\" target=\"_blank\">Karakalpakstan</a> and Turkmenistan is a very large wheel diameter. In Uzbekistan arba was known as \"Kukon arava\".</p>

<p>The design of the Uzbek arba has several explanations. First of all, big wheels made it possible to move faster on uneven terrain, not to roll over when hitting large stones. Due to the fact that the riders were sitting high, they did not have time to get the dust in the summer.</p>

<p>For a long time the Uzbek arba has been used as a mode of transport, as it was very practical and convenient. And today such carts can be seen in the countryside, but they are becoming less and less.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"arba\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/arba.jpg\" width=\"715\" /></div><br />

<p>The most interesting thing is that the design of a vehicle of past years does not actually differ from what we see today. You can see the medieval arba in the museums of Uzbekistan. And you can realize this opportunity during your long-expected <a href=\"[[~1]]\" target=\"_blank\">tour to Uzbekistan</a>.</p>

{{<p>Today’s <a href=\"[[~163]]\" target=\"_blank\">cities of Uzbekistan</a> are built up with apartment and single-storey houses of different periods: starting from model and experimental houses built before and after 1966, and ending with new buildings of certificate housing, better known as “bank houses”.</p>

<p>But there are mahalyas (one-story districts), where traditional Uzbek houses on earth still exist. In this article you will learn about the traditional way of life of Uzbeks, and more specifically about the Uzbek housing.</p>

<p>During the construction of housing, the <a href=\"[[~3140]]\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbek people</a> took into account the relief and weather conditions. Therefore, each city had its own traditions.<br />
So, for example, in the <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Fergana Valley</a>, considered to be a seismic zone, houses with double frames were erected, and in Khorezm, where there is no seismicity, houses were built with one frame. Or, for example, if in the Fergana Valley, because of the abundance of rain, clay laths (lumbaz) up to 40–50 cm thick are placed on the roofs of houses, then in Khorezm the thickness of lumbaz is no more than 10–15 cm, since here is much less rainfall.</p>

<p>Although in different areas the housing construction of the Uzbeks differed in some originality, there were also general principles of architecture. Old settlements usually consisted of curves and narrow streets along which houses with no windows were built, surrounded by mud walls. All windows, both residential and outbuildings, went out only into the courtyard.</p>

<p>In the better-off families, the premises in the Uzbek traditional house were divided into two parts - ichkari (internal), for children and women, and tashkari (mehmonhona), a more beautiful and richly furnished part for guests. Usually, most middle-income families were provided with a separate guest room (mehmonhona). The poor had not such a room. The planning of the dwelling houses of most families, which depended on the number of its members, included an aivan (shed), an utility room, a farmyard and a toilet in the yard.</p>

<p>The opening of the entrance door was always low, so that people entering and leaving it would bend down, that is, make a bow, as the threshold of the house is considered sacred. A light bow helped to show respect for the house, its inhabitants and the country.</p>

<p>The hot climate, sudden changes in temperature during the day and seasons are the main factors that must be considered when designing national housing in Uzbekistan. A building that can withstand overheating in summer and cooling in winter, and during periods of comfortable temperature, allows fresh air to penetrate as much as possible inside, perhaps ideal for living in Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>Of course, the traditional Uzbek houses, thanks to the accumulated diversity of architectural and planning techniques, made it possible to organize the space and create a comfortable microclimate even on the hottest days rationally. The ventilation system, sun protection and the corresponding orientation of the buildings, thermal performance, watering and landscaping of the local area - all this contributed to creating maximum comfort for all family members.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"traditional Uzbek house\"  src=\"images/Tashkent sights/traditional-Uzbek-house.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<p>The verandahs where people rested in the summer helped to escape from the intense heat. For example, in Khorezm, the verandas were high and wide. A pool was built around each Uzbek house. Elms grew around the houses. They have the ability to cool the air.<br />
In <a href=\"[[~190]]\" target=\"_blank\">Tashkent</a>, <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a> and <a href=\"[[~339]]\" target=\"_blank\">Khiva</a>, depending on the climatic conditions, high and beautifully decorated summer rooms were facing north with their facade, while the winter rooms were located opposite the facade to the south.</p>

<p>In the past, in many Uzbek houses, sandalwood served as means of heating. It was a low square table that was placed above a small depression in the dirt floor with burning coals. In winter, a sandalwood table was covered with a large blanket, and on top it was covered with a tablecloth. The man, sitting down at the table in winter, covered his arms and legs with a blanket. Often, family members went to bed around sandalwood. In addition to sandalwood, in different areas of the country there were various means of heating. Modern Uzbek houses are heated centrally or individually. They are equipped with running water, sewage and gas. The mansions are planted round with fruit trees, vineyard and flowers.</p>

<p>In Uzbek families, the decoration of housing accommodation was traditionally important. Usually the floor was covered with a carpet, on which narrow quilted blankets (kurpacha) were. Usually not used kurpacha was folded on the chest or in the wall niches of the living room. And in the middle of the room a tablecloth with all sorts of dishes, fruits, sweets and always freshly baked cakes was spread out. Colorfully embroidered pillows were laid out in the sitting room; and chests with kurpacha were covered with richly embroidered suzane.</p>

<p>Today, most Uzbek people live in multistoried houses with all the improvements: modern plumbing, water, gas and electricity. Also one and two-story cottages with homestead lands, built mainly of baked bricks, are becoming widespread. Home furnishings, both in the city and in large villages, are mainly traditional, but the furniture consists of factory-made products of the modern type. Thus, in the design of residential premises both local and imported sets, including a variety of dishes, carpet products, telecommunications, as well as various paintings and photographs, are used.</p>

{{<p>The Eastern turban (or chalma) is a wardrobe item, which is a long piece of rectangular fabric that should be wrapped around the head. The canvas is fitted in a certain sequence, thereby creating a full-fledged headdress.</p>

<p>The Eastern turban was originally a man\'s headdress. Then and now it was worn in Asia and Africa, in the states of the Arabian Peninsula, in India, and also in those countries where Islam is the official religion. Over time, the tradition of wearing this headdress was adopted by women. Today, the turban allows the women to look stylish and elegant. But it was not always so.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbek turban\"  src=\"images/Uzbek traditions/turban.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></div>

<h2>Historical information about the turban</h2>

<p>The first mention of the turban refers to the VII century. The story of the turban helping a Muslim to become a pious, loyal and decent man is contained in the ancient Hadiths. The sources of the acts and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad stated that it was he who commanded to wear it to all representatives of Islam. The turban was necessary for Muhammad and his associates to participate in worship.</p>

<p>In the XIII century, during the existence of the Arab Caliphate, the turban became mandatory for all men. The boys wore children\'s hats, but with their maturing hats were changed to the turban. Depriving the turban was a shame.</p>

<p>The size of the turbans depended on the social status of the person, and the color depended on the nationality and religion. And if a man died suddenly, his turban was used to wrap the body.</p>

<p>In the Ottoman Empire of the 15th – 16th centuries, a sultan wore the turban of the maximum size. Its height sometimes reached more than 70 centimeters. The size of the turban decreased depending on the position on the career ladder.</p>

<p>Turban was not only a sign of religiosity, but was also functional. Turban served as a protection from the burning sun and wind.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"chalma\"  src=\"images/Uzbek traditions/chalma.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></div>

<h2>Turban: art of wearing</h2>

<p>Tilting the turban was not so easy. It required special knowledge and experience. Therefore, there was a special profession - dastorband, who helped noble people to wrap a turban properly and beautifully. Gems and feathers of birds, which were not only an ornament, but also a symbol of power and amulet, were often used as decoration of the Eastern turban.</p>

<h2>Tradition to wear a turban in Uzbekistan</h2>

<p>If we talk <a href=\"[[~124]]\" target=\"_blank\">about Uzbekistan</a>, today it is rarely possible to meet an Uzbek in a turban. Mostly a religious person or an elderly Uzbek wears a turban. For that, you can meet a young Uzbek woman in a fashionable modern turban. Time passes and the fashion for the turban has somehow changed.<br />

{{<p>Historical and architectural monuments of the ancient <a href=\"[[~163]]\" target=\"_blank\">cities of Uzbekistan</a> are unique, inimitable and adequately occupy a leading place among the monuments of Central Asia.<br />
<br />
It is known that on the territory of modern Uzbekistan there were ten main types of structures. They were residential houses, religious, civil, commercial buildings, medical, administrative, educational institutions, economic and industrial buildings and palaces.<br />
<br />
It should be noted that the buildings of the medieval period are the most numerous and little studied. Here it is important to note one of the most interesting and mysterious forms of Oriental architecture - the minaret. Minarets adorn the cityscapes in all countries of the Muslim East, and even became the hallmark of many cities. Translated from the Arabic \"minaret\" means \"a place where something is lit\" or \"emitting light.\" It is a spiritual light, a human soul that seeks enlightenment.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Uzbekistan minarets\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/Uzbekistan-minarets.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<p>In independent Uzbekistan, minarets, having acquired a special status as objects of invaluable cultural heritage, are under state protection.<br />
<br />
The earliest references to detached minarets in Uzbekistan are found in the medieval author Narshahi in the “<a href=\"[[~186]]\" target=\"_blank\">History of Bukhara</a>”. This is “a wooden-topped minaret built in <a href=\"[[~181]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara</a> next to the cathedral mosque by order of the vizier Abu Ubaidullah Djehani in 306.</p>

<p>In <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a>, during the excavations carried out in 1904, on the site of the ancient cathedral mosque, the square basement and the second link of the minaret, built of burnt brick no later than the 10th century, were found. The earliest known and preserved buildings of this type on the territory of Uzbekistan include: <a href=\"[[~598]]\" target=\"_blank\">Termez</a> minaret (1032) near the Chor-Sutun mosque and <a href=\"[[~769]]\" target=\"_blank\">Bukhara minaret Kalyan</a> (1127). A later, but no less original, is Bukhara compact monument with the consonant name <a href=\"[[~770]]\" target=\"_blank\">Chor-Minor</a> with four minarets at the corners of the cubical volume of a small building.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"minarets of Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/minarets-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<p>The <a href=\"[[~773]]\" target=\"_blank\">Dzharkurgan minaret</a>, located in Uzbekistan (the Surkhandarya region in the village Minor) is the earliest and, perhaps, the most unique of the similar structures that have survived to the present day. The building belonged to a large cathedral mosque, lined with baked bricks.</p>

<p>We would like to pay special attention to the facts concerning the preservation of minarets in Uzbekistan of the era of Temurids of the Renaissance. First of all, it is the minaret at the Samarkand mausoleum<a href=\"[[~776]]\" target=\"_blank\"> Gur-Emir</a>. It is attached to the square courtyard of the complex with four minarets at its corners, which includes the Muhammad-Sultan madrasah and khanaka. They constituted a single ensemble, from which only the mausoleum, the courtyard with the portal and the first links of the two minarets have survived.</p>

<p>The structure of the master Hudaibergen-Khoja, the <a href=\"[[~761]]\" target=\"_blank\">Islam-Khoja minaret</a>, one of the largest in Central Asia, stands out among the later structures.</p>

<p>Another <a href=\"[[~339]]\" target=\"_blank\">Khiva</a> minaret - <a href=\"[[~762]]\" target=\"_blank\">Kalta Minor</a>, which was to become the largest in the world, amazes its boldness of the plan and its size (diameter - 14 m and height - 26 m).</p>

<p>Since the XIV - XV centuries, minarets in Uzbekistan became more numerous than ritual functions required. They were erected either as a symbol of state or personal prestige, or as not functional, but a necessary aesthetic component of the composition of the building.</p>

<p>Vertical minarets played a huge role in the appearance of the cities of the East (in Uzbekistan this is most clearly represented in <a href=\"[[~2736]]\" target=\"_blank\">Ichan-Kala in Khiva</a>) and created a clear system of spatial landmarks when perceiving the city, noting the places of large mosques, madrasahs, complexes.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"The minarets of Uzbekistan\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/The-minaret-of-Uzbekistan.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div>

<h2>Minaret functions</h2>

<p>Minarets in Uzbekistan were built at almost every madrasah and were used to announce the start of classes, lunch break, news and emergency meetings. Free-standing minarets served as a defense function, as they were used for visual observations. A striking example of this in Uzbekistan is the minaret Kalyan in Bukhara.</p>

<p>On many minarets an arched lantern (a covered rotunda, where the man climbed, calling on the faithful to prayer) was built. But the performed functions largely depended on the design and variety of the minaret.</p>

{{<p>In the contemporary world, cultural and historical heritage, among other things, has become, a real brand. After all, values with a rich history are unique, they have passed the test of time, and are easily recognizable.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is natural, such an approach is fully justified. With the proviso that the generated images are consonant with reliable sources, documents, information without bias in one direction or another.</p>

<p>One of such world famous historical brands is the Great Silk Road. Its exceptional popularity is due to the tremendous importance for the region and the continent, the development of civilization as a whole.<br />
The routes of the Silk Road, as is known, are inherently connected with our country. This article will tell you about which role was determined to the ancient <a href=\"[[~163]]\" target=\"_blank\">cities of Uzbekistan</a> on the first transport artery between the East and the West, appreciating not only the economic, but also the cultural and humanitarian component.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Silk trade route\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/Silk-trade-route.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div>

<h2>How did it all start?</h2>

<p>There is evidence, confirmed by a number of studies that the history of Silk trade routes in the Uzbekistan region goes back several thousand years. At all times, the all-round evolution of nations was associated with the origination of transit and trade routes. For many centuries BC, relations between nations began to develop rapidly in most parts of Central Asia. As it is known from historical sources in the Bronze Age, our region was connected by trade routes with its neighbors. Among the routes there were the so-called Lazurite Route, which brought gems from Central Asia to Iran, Mesopotamia and Egypt; the Shakh Route of the Ahamenid era, as well as other routes.</p>

<p>If we allude to the ancient manuscripts, the beginning of the Great Silk Road functioning dates from the second half of the 2nd century BC, when the Chinese diplomat and traveler Zhang Jian first opened the Western territory for the Celestial Empire - the states of Central Asia. Thus, according to the academician Edward Rtveladze, two great roads were connected into one whole, which previously went into unknown lands. One - from the west from the Mediterranean countries, traversed by the Hellenes and Macedonians during the campaigns of Alexander the Great and the Seleucids; the other - from the east from the Han Empire, explored by Zhang Jian, who passed this region from north to south through Davan (Fergana), Kanguy (Central Asian Mesopotamia) and Bactria.</p>

<p>The Chinese traveler was awaited by an impressive sight at that time: in the <a href=\"[[~576]]\" target=\"_blank\">Fergana Valley</a> he counted more than 70 urban settlements. Here craft and agriculture were developed, and the inhabitants were trading with India, the Near and Middle East, as well as with Greece and Rome. Zhang Jian reported on everything to the emperor, and also spoke about the amazing beauty of the horses he had seen. The traveler advised to improve relations with the rulers of this region. In 121 BC, the first caravan loaded with silk and bronze mirrors set off along the Great Silk Road. Its destination was the Fergana oasis.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Great Silk Route\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/Great-Silk-Route.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />

<p>By the way, the familiar, now branded name of the transcontinental route - the Silk Road – has become established by historical standards relatively recently. This term (in German “Seidenstrassen”) was introduced into scientific use by the geographer Ferdinand von Richthofen in 1877. Silk, as it was noted by another German scientist Albert Hermann, was the main product that introduced the two different worlds - East and West.</p>

<p>If not to go into the legends and traditions about the history of silk deeply, then it is worth mentioning that it began to be produced in China two thousand years BC. This thin and pleasant fabric very soon began to be produced in rather large quantities, while other countries could not even guess from what it is made - “as light as a cloud” and “as transparent as ice”. Due to the fact that the Chinese kept the secret of production carefully, outside of the Celestial Empire, it cost fabulous money. This made the export of silk fabric one of the biggest sources of profit. Long before the adjusted communication, separate, irregular caravans were sent to the West, carrying rolls of precious linen.</p>

<h2>The role of Uzbek cities on the Silk trade and economic routes of that time</h2>

<p>The Great Silk Road was of great significance for its era. Starting from the Chinese Xian and passing through East Turkestan, Central Asia, Iran, Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean Sea, it had a length of nearly 12 thousand kilometers. And the Uzbek region was located in its very center.</p>

<p>At that time, in Central Asia, prototypes of the current logistics centers — caravanserais — were being formed. Many merchants did not go all the way of the Silk Route from China to Europe, which would have taken them many months, but they were engaged in transit supplies, bartering goods from partners. Often merchants bought products, for example, in <a href=\"[[~164]]\" target=\"_blank\">Samarkand</a>, <a href=\"[[~598]]\" target=\"_blank\">Termez</a>, which, in particular, is evidence of traces of imported goods found during excavations. Ancient Chinese “wu shu” coins, as well as the minted coins of the Tang dynasty, were found in Fergana and surrounding areas from the second century BC.</p>

<p>Ancient cities and regions located on the territory of <a href=\"[[~124]]\" target=\"_blank\">contemporary Uzbekistan</a> turned into not only centers of transit trade, but also developed production of that time. For example, Chach - the current metropolitan area - in the early Middle Ages became the largest ore-metallurgical region of Central Asia, where precious and non-ferrous metals, iron ore and gems were mined. According to contemporaries, Chach supplied to other lands high-quality woolen fabrics, beautifully tanned leather, famous fighting bows and arrows, saddles that were in great demand among the soldiers of the steppes and cities, quivers, rugs, blankets, furs and skins, fur clothes, cotton, cocoons. silkworm, flaxseed, iron scissors and needles, grain products, glazed ceramic dishes.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages, cities were actively developing; trade relations were ascertained with the countries of the West, including Southern and Eastern Europe, and in the east - with China. For example, a Samanid dirham treasure found near modern Chinaz can be an evidence of the great trade. The significant flourishing of the Great Silk Road also fell on the board of Amir Temur, when safety was ensured on all roads, and scientists and architects from all over the world gathered in the cities of his vast state. Sakhibkiran created favorable conditions for the rapid development of handicraft business. The role of our region not only as a transshipment point in trans regional trade, but also as a manufacturer of high-quality goods increased significantly.</p>

<p>In the judgment of historians, the convenient geographical position contributed to the fact that Central Asia and Uzbekistan, in particular, became the epicenter of the most important ethnic processes - migration of peoples, active interaction of cultures. Thanks to the Great Silk Road, vigorous activity was conducted: large-scale trade operations were carried out, diplomatic treaties and alliances were concluded. The peoples of Central Asia have an outstanding significance in the distribution of letters and world religions, as well as many cultural and technical achievements.</p>

<p>The combination of factors makes it possible to say that the Great Silk Road is not just a caravan route, but a multifunctional phenomenon unique in the history of Eurasia, the degree of influence of which on many aspects of its existence was enormous.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Silk Route\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/Silk-route.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div>

<h2>Popular products of the Great Silk Road</h2>

<p>The beginning of trade relations accelerated the collection of semi-precious stones in Central Asia, such as lapis lazuli, jade, carnelian and turquoise, which were evaluated in the East.</p>

<p>Camels, carpets, cotton fabrics, exotic fruits, sheep, dogs, glassware, gold and silver, embroidered clothing, horses, leopard and lion skin, military equipment were exported from Central Asia.</p>

<p>From the east caravans carried porcelain, cosmetics, dishes, tea and rice, and elephant tusks, rhino horns, tortoiseshell, and other goods were carried to the west.</p>

<div class=\"photos_line_new\" align=\"center\"><img alt=\"products of the Silk Road\"  src=\"images/about Uzbekistan/items-Silk-Road.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></div><br />
