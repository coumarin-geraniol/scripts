But traditionally Uzbek samsa is baked from flavour with different kinds of meat.\r\nTraditional Uzbek samsa is cooked in tandyr (Central Asian stove). But there is also a kind of samsa (usually triangular and square shape), which is prepared in the electric and gas ovens.\r\nIt is amazing, but, samsa is considered to be an absolutely correct dish, cause it is steamed in tandyr, without frying, that makes samsa health food. The natural fat in samsa is the most \"useful\" cholesterol, which makes our blood vessels strong.",
