The Savitsky Art Museum is a hidden treasure trove of artistic and historical importance.\r\n\r\nOn your way to the Aral Sea tour, you will have the chance to explore ancient ruins of a lighthouse on the former banks of the sea on the Ustyurt Plateau.

They have a museum that explains what the area was like before the exploitation of the environment changed the way of life, forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA visit to Sudochie Lake will give you more insight into what has been lost, as it is home to over 200 species of birds. Some endangered species have even been discovered in the wetland among the reedbeds of the lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour trip to explore the Aral Sea will be by 4x4 SUV, and what adventure would be complete without an overnight stay in a yurt, with dinner around the campfire. Your tour of the Aralkum Desert will allow you to experience huge salt fields, which appear in the distance as if they are snow-covered hills.

The 4th largest inland sea in the world, covered an area of over 67,000 square kilometers before construction began, with a length of 427km or 265 miles.\r\n\r\nIrrigation was needed to serve cotton plantations in the area. With the irrigation system in place, the plantations grew in size, greatly increasing the water from the Amudarya and the Syrdarya rivers used in irrigation. These were the main rivers flowing into the Aral, with the loss of water causing the unforeseen destruction of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Beautiful Contradiction\r\n\r\nThe Aral Sea is a contradiction. On the one hand, a disaster to the environment and the lives of the people living in the region. And on the other, a uniquely beautiful and strange place of contrasts, which are difficult to find anywhere else.\r\n\r\nUnderstandably, travel to the Aral Sea is attracting more tourists, for both its amazing scenery and the tragic appeal the region offers.
